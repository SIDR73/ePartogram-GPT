The majority of these deaths \\noccur in low-resource settings and are largely preventable through timely interventions (3). \\nMonitoring of labour and childbirth, and early identification and treatment of complications \\nare critical for preventing adverse birth outcomes. Improving the quality of care around the \\ntime of birth has been identified as the most impactful strategy for reducing stillbirths and \\nmaternal and newborn deaths, compared with antenatal or postnatal care strategies (4).\\nIn February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a consolidated set \\nof recommendations on intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). The \\nrecommendations include new definitions of the duration of the first and second stages of \\nlabour and provide guidance on the timing and use of labour interventions to improve the \\nhealth and well-being of women and their babies (5–7). The recommendations are based on \\nthe principle that, through the use of effective labour and childbirth practices and avoidance \\nof ineffective (and potentially harmful) practices, health personnel can support women to \\nachieve their desired physical, emotional and psychological outcomes for themselves, their \\nbabies and their families (8). \\nWHO recommendations on intrapartum care specify evidence-based practices that should \\nbe implemented throughout labour and the immediate postnatal periods, and discourage \\nineffective practices that should be avoided. WHO recommendations cover:\\n\\x1d\\x1d care throughout labour and birth: respectful maternity care, effective communication, \\nlabour companionship, and continuity of care;\\n\\x1d\\x1d first stage of labour: definition of the latent and active first stages, duration and \\nprogression of the first stage, labour ward admission policy, clinical pelvimetry on \\nadmission, routine assessment of fetal well-being on labour admission, pubic shaving, \\nenema on admission, digital vaginal examination, vaginal cleansing, continuous \\ncardiotocography, intermittent fetal heart rate (FHR) auscultation, pain relief, oral \\nfluid and food, maternal mobility and position, active management of labour, routine \\namniotomy, oxytocin for preventing delay, antispasmodic agents, and intravenous fluids \\nfor preventing labour delay;\\n\\x1d\\x1d second stage of labour: definition and duration of the second stage of labour, birth \\nposition (with and without epidural analgesia), methods of pushing, techniques for \\npreventing perineal trauma, episiotomy, and fundal pressure;\\n\\x1d\\x1d third stage of labour: prophylactic uterotonics, delayed umbilical cord clamping, \\ncontrolled cord traction, and uterine massage;\\n\\x1d\\x1d care of the newborn: routine nasal or oral suction during resuscitation, skin-to-skin \\ncontact, breastfeeding, haemorrhagic disease prophylaxis using vitamin K, and bathing \\nand other immediate postnatal care of the newborn;\\n\\x1d\\x1d care of the woman after birth: uterine tonus assessment, use of antibiotics, routine \\npostpartum maternal assessment, and discharge following uncomplicated vaginal birth.\\nTo facilitate effective implementation of the above recommendations, WHO reviewed and \\nrevised the design of the previous partograph. The LCG was designed for health personnel \\nto monitor the well-being of women and babies during labour through regular assessments \\nto identify any deviation from normality. The tool aims to stimulate shared decision-making \\nby health-care providers and women, and to promote women-centred care. The LCG is \\nintended as a resource to ensure quality evidence-based care, with a special emphasis on \\nensuring safety, avoiding unnecessary interventions, and providing supportive care.'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 9}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n2\\nObjective of this manual\\nThis manual has been developed to help health personnel who care for women during labour \\nand childbirth to successfully use the LCG.\\nTarget audience\\nThe primary target audience for this manual is skilled health personnel directly providing \\nlabour and childbirth care in all settings. This includes midwives, nurses, general medical \\npractitioners and obstetricians. The manual will also be of interest to staff involved in \\ntraining health care personnel, health-care facility managers, implementers and managers \\nof maternal and child health programmes, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and \\nprofessional societies involved in the planning and management of maternal and child health \\nservices.\\nThe Labour Care Guide\\nThe principal aims of the LCG are to:\\n\\x1d\\x1d guide the monitoring and documentation of the well-being of women and babies and the \\nprogress of labour\\n\\x1d\\x1d guide skilled health personnel to offer supportive care throughout labour to ensure a \\npositive childbirth experience for women\\n\\x1d\\x1d assist skilled health personnel to promptly identify and address emerging labour \\ncomplications, by providing reference thresholds for labour observations that are intended \\nto trigger reflection and specific action(s) if an abnormal observation is identified\\n\\x1d\\x1d prevent unnecessary use of interventions in labour\\n\\x1d\\x1d support audit and quality improvement of labour management.\\nFor whom should the LCG be used?\\nThe LCG has been designed for the care of women and their babies during labour and \\nchildbirth. It includes assessments and observations that are essential for the care of all \\npregnant women, regardless of their risk status. However, the LCG was primarily designed \\nto be used for the care of apparently healthy pregnant women and their babies (i.e. women \\nwith low-risk pregnancies). Women at high risk of developing labour complications may \\nrequire additional specialized monitoring and care (9).\\nUpon arrival in the labour unit, women should have an initial assessment to determine \\nwhether labour has started. Detailed guidance on how to perform an initial evaluation to \\nassess the well-being of the woman and her baby and determine the stage of labour can be \\nfound in Pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care: a guide for essential practice (10). \\nWomen in labour will require further monitoring of the progress of labour with the LCG. \\nWhen should the LCG be initiated?\\nDocumentation on the LCG of the well-being of the woman and her baby as well as \\nprogression of labour should be initiated when the woman enters active phase of the first \\nstage of labour (5\\xa0cm or more cervical dilatation), regardless of her parity and membranes \\nstatus. \\nAlthough the LCG should not be initiated in the latent phase of labour, it is expected that \\nwomen and their babies are monitored and receive labour care and support during the latent \\nstage. Detailed guidance on care for women in the latent phase of labour can be found in \\nPregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care: a guide for essential practice (10).'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 10}, page_content='3\\nWhere should the LCG be used?\\nThe LCG is designed to be used for all births in health facilities, including primary, secondary \\nand tertiary care settings. Women giving birth in lower-level facilities may require referral to \\na higher level of care if complications ensue. Women in such settings should therefore have \\naccess to appropriate referral and transportation options for safe and timely transfer. The \\nuse of the LCG can facilitate early identification of potential complications; hence, it should \\ncontribute to timely referrals when required. \\nStructure of the LCG\\nThe LCG has seven sections, which were adapted from the previous partograph design. The \\nsections are as follows (see Fig. 1):\\n1. Identifying information and labour characteristics at admission\\n2. Supportive care\\n3. Care of the baby\\n4. Care of the woman\\n5. Labour progress\\n6. Medication\\n7. Shared decision-making\\nSection 1 is for documenting the woman’s name and labour admission characteristics that \\nare important for labour management: parity, mode of labour onset, date of active labour \\ndiagnosis, date and time of rupture of membranes, and risk factors. This section should be \\ncompleted with the information obtained when active labour diagnosis is confirmed.\\nSections 2–7 contain a list of labour observations. The health-care provider should record \\nobservations for all sections soon after the woman is admitted to the labour ward. The \\nremainder of the LCG is then completed following subsequent assessments throughout \\nlabour. For all observations, there is a horizontal time axis for documentation of the \\ncorresponding time of observation and a vertical reference values axis for determination of \\nany deviation from normal observations. The LCG also provides a second-stage section to \\ncontinue the observations made during the first stage of labour (except for cervical dilatation \\nassessment, which ends at the first stage of labour).\\nTHE LABOUR CARE GUIDE\\nSummary of key points on starting to use the LCG\\nFor whom should the LCG be used?\\nAll women in labour.

The decision to intervene in the course of labour is primarily \\nbased on observation of a deviation from expected observations during these assessments. \\nTo facilitate action-oriented labour monitoring, the LCG provides explicit reference values \\nfor labour observations and includes a section to document shared decisions to address \\nany deviation from the expected norm. To ensure the systematic and consistent application \\nof the LCG, health providers are encouraged to use the Assess\\xa0Ò\\xa0Record\\xa0Ò\\xa0Check\\xa0Ò\\xa0Plan \\napproach, which involves: \\n\\x1d\\x1d Assess (assess the well-being of woman and her baby, and progress of labour)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Record (document labour observations)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Check reference threshold  (compare labour observations with reference values in the \\n“Alert” column)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Plan (decide whether and what interventions are required, in consultation with the \\nwoman, and document accordingly).\\nIt is important for health-care providers to prospectively monitor the well-\\nbeing of women and babies and the progression of labour, and to apply the \\nAssess\\xa0Ò\\xa0Record\\xa0Ò\\xa0Check\\xa0Ò\\xa0Plan process at each assessment throughout labour. \\nThe sections below provide explanations on how to complete the LCG. A clinical example \\nfollows each section to illustrate the use of the LCG. \\nThe LCG is intended as a guide and is not a substitute for good clinical judgment with \\nrespect to the individual women’s circumstances and preferences. \\nFurther guidance on the clinical management of women during labour and childbirth, \\nincluding management of complications, can be found in Pregnancy, Childbirth, Postpartum \\nand Newborn Care: A guide for essential practice (10) and Managing complications in pregnancy \\nand childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors (9). \\nFor practical reasons this manual describes women’s and babies’ observations separately. \\nHowever, decisions should not be based on findings from individual observations, but rather \\non an overall assessment of the woman and her baby. \\nUsing the LCG\\nTime axis: The first row of the time axis (“Time”) is to register the actual time for each \\nobservation, while the second row (“Hours”) identifies the number of hours that have \\nelapsed during the course of labour (see Fig. 2). The “Time” row is divided into columns for \\nrecording the actual time in hours and minutes. Each column represents 1 clock hour. \\nAs described in the example below, if the first assessment is conducted at 06:30 and the \\nsecond and third assessments are conducted 1 and 2\\xa0hours later, at 07:30 and 08:30, these \\nshould all be recorded in the respective columns. If at 12:30 the woman reaches full cervical \\ndilatation, recording of time in the cells under the second stage should continue. \\nIf labour extends beyond 12 hours, a second LCG form should be commenced. Time should \\nbe recorded using the 12- or 24-hour format, depending on local practice.\\nThe reference (“Alert”) column:  The “Alert” column presents thresholds for abnormal \\nlabour observations that require further assessment and action by the health-care provider, \\nas summarized in Tables 3–7. If labour observations do not meet any of the criteria in the \\n“Alert” column, labour progression and care should be regarded as normal, and no medical \\nintervention is warranted.\\nHOW TO USE THE LABOUR CARE GUIDE'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 13}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n6\\nHealth-care providers should circle any observations meeting the criteria in the “Alert” \\ncolumn. This should help to highlight those observations that require special attention. \\nWhile the reference thresholds are largely based on WHO guidance, a few were derived \\nfrom expert consensus. It is important to note that the reference thresholds are meant to be \\nused as early-warning signals. Therefore, reference values should be adapted in accordance \\nwith local guidelines and should not replace the expert clinical judgement of a care provider.\\nFrequency of assessment:  The frequency of observations is similar to that in the previous \\npartograph design, as presented in Tables 4–7. While the frequency of assessment in the \\nLCG is largely based on WHO guidance, for some variables the frequency of monitoring \\nis based on expert consensus rather than high quality evidence. It is important that \\nhealth personnel adapt the monitoring frequencies to each particular clinical case and in \\naccordance with local guidelines. It is expected that the required frequency of assessment \\nwill depend on the results of labour observations and the status of the woman and her baby.\\nNomenclature to complete the LCG \\nWhere a measurement is numerical, actual numbers should be recorded.

Clear explanations of procedures and their purpose should always be provided to each \\nwoman. The findings of physical examinations should be explained to the woman and her \\ncompanion, and the subsequent course of action made clear to enable shared decision-\\nmaking.\\nThis section of the LCG aims to encourage the consistent practice of respectful maternity \\ncare during labour and childbirth, through the continuous provision and monitoring of \\nsupportive care. This includes labour companionship, access to pharmacological and \\nnon-pharmacological pain relief, ensuring women are offered oral fluid, and techniques to \\nimprove women’s comfort (such as encouraging women to be mobile during labour) (see \\nTable 3). Supportive care measures should be offered and evaluated continuously during \\nlabour. However, to streamline documentation, observations regarding the provision of \\nsupportive care should be recorded every hour.

ADAPTING THE WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE\\nANNEX 2\\nAdapting the WHO Labour Care Guide \\nThe WHO Labour Care Guide has been developed to align with WHO recommendations on \\nintrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). Some adaptations may be needed to \\nreflect local conventions (e.g. the use of Hodge planes for classifying fetal descent).\\nRemoving recommended practices from the LCG is strongly discouraged. Even in those \\nsettings where some interventions are less feasible or not consistently available, monitoring \\nthe use of these interventions is important to help drive improvements in overall quality of \\ncare.\\nBelow we describe a process for reviewing the LCG and identifying elements to be adapted \\n(see Fig. 9).\\nFig. 9. Process for adapting the LCG\\nAim for quality  \\nof care\\nAny adaptations of the LCG should be undertaken with \\ncaution to ensure that effective interventions are not \\nremoved. \\nNational or local experts should review the LCG in light \\nof relevant national standards and guidelines. Health-\\ncare providers working in maternity-care settings should \\nbe involved in adaptation activities.\\nPrior to any rollout of an adapted LCG, pilot it in clinical \\nsettings and encourage end-users’ feedback. This can \\nfacilitate successful adoption.\\nKeep the LCG focused on labour monitoring and avoid \\nincorporating too many new variables. The LCG should \\nnot replace a medical record. The more items are added, \\nthe more likely clinicians are to record variables twice. \\nWhen incorporating new variables or parameters, \\nconsider: \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it relevant for labour monitoring? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it evidence based? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it feasible to collect it in any different setting? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it already in the medical record?\\n\\x1d\\x1d Would it be more appropriate in the medical record?\\nInvolve experts  \\nand end-users\\nPilot the adapted  \\nLCG\\nKeep it concise'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 33}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n26\\nANNEX 3\\nIntroducing the WHO Labour Care Guide  \\ninto labour wards\\nThe LCG is a tool that aims to support implementation of the WHO recommendations: \\nintrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). The current level of implementation of \\ndifferent care practices in the LCG may vary. For example, the LCG includes practices that \\nmay already be well implemented in labour wards (e.g. offering pharmacological pain relief). \\nOther practices may not be well implemented, and the LCG can help managers and health-\\ncare providers to set goals to improve the quality of labour and childbirth care. \\nIt is well known that simply disseminating recommendations will not ensure their \\nsuccessful adoption by health-care providers (15). There may also be additional barriers \\nto implementing the LCG into routine care. For example, providers in facilities with high \\nworkloads or fewer resources may consider the LCG time consuming or less feasible. In \\nother facilities, providers may be unwilling to update their long-standing practice or may \\nbe otherwise resistant to adopting the LCG in routine care. In such situations, a robust \\nimplementation strategy should be designed to introduce the LCG into labour wards. \\nTo introduce the LCG in labour care wards, an active multi-component implementation \\nstrategy will be required. A pilot study in six countries identified a number of strategies for \\nimplementing the LCG (16) (see Table 9).\\nTable 9. Strategies for implementing the LCG\\nReview and adaptation Leadership and training\\n✔ Critically review the LCG and decide whether local \\nadaptation is needed.\\n✔ Ensure the abbreviations that providers are \\nrequired to use in the LCG are locally meaningful.\\n✔ Involve local leaders and administrators in \\nadaptation activities.\\n✔ Optimize providers’ time: minimize any duplication \\nof recording between the LCG and medical record.\\n✔ Avoid adding variables, mainly if they are not \\nmeaningful for labour and childbirth care.\\n✔ Target best quality; do not remove LCG \\ncomponents just because they cannot be \\naccomplished.\\n✔ Review policies and associated procedures \\nrequired to provide an enabling environment for \\nuse of the LCG.\\n✔ Translate the LCG, manual and other educational \\nmaterials if necessary.\\n✔ Build a team with expertise in LCG, from various \\ndisciplines (obstetrics, midwifery, nursing), to \\nprovide training. \\n✔ Ask thought leaders and local champions to \\nfamiliarize themselves with the LCG.\\n✔ Plan initial training, refresher trainings and \\ncontinuous support and mentoring activities.\\n✔ Include a strong practical component in the \\ntraining programme.\\n✔ Give time for skills acquisition. Providers may find \\nthe LCG initially offputting, and will need some \\ntime to familiarize with the LCG.\\n✔ Conduct training in the local language. \\n✔ Provide early and structured feedback on \\ncompleted LCGs to help users improve their skills. \\nTeamwork in completing the LCG Monitoring and evaluation\\n✔ The use of the LCG should be the responsibility of \\nthe entire health-care team.\\n✔ The LCG guides objective data-driven decision-\\nmaking. Take into account that some staff \\ncompleting the LCG may require extra support and \\nsupervision.\\n✔ Target universal implementation (in all shifts). The \\nLCG can work well to support handover between \\nshifts.\\n✔ Maintain or establish a monitoring system based \\non the LCG to track quality-of-care indicators, for \\nexample the proportion of women with a labour \\ncompanion of choice, and the caesarean section \\nrate.\\n✔ Show and share quality-of-care indicators to help \\ndrive improvements.

SUMMARY LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON INTRAPARTUM CARE FOR FOR A POSITIVE CHILDBIRTH EXPERIENCE\\nANNEX 4\\nSummary list of recommendations on intrapartum \\ncare for for a positive childbirth experience\\nCare option  Recommendation Category of \\nrecommendation\\nCare throughout labour and birth\\nRespectful maternity \\ncare\\n1. Respectful maternity care – which refers to care \\norganized for and provided to all women in a manner \\nthat maintains their dignity, privacy and confidentiality, \\nensures freedom from harm and mistreatment, and \\nenables informed choice and continuous support during \\nlabour and childbirth – is recommended.\\nRecommended\\nEffective \\ncommunication\\n2. Effective communication between maternity care \\nproviders and women in labour, using simple and \\nculturally acceptable methods is recommended.\\nRecommended\\nCompanionship 3. A companion of choice is recommended for all women \\nthroughout labour and childbirth.\\nRecommended\\nContinuity of care 4. Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known \\nmidwife or small group of midwives supports a woman \\nthroughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal \\ncontinuum, are recommended in settings with well-\\nfunctioning midwifery programmes.\\nContext-specific \\nrecommendation\\nFirst stage of labour\\nDefinitions of the \\nlatent and active first \\nstages of labour\\n5. The use of the following definitions of the latent and \\nactive first stages of labour is recommended for practice:\\n \" The latent, first stage is a period of time characterized \\nby painful uterine contractions and variable changes of \\nthe cervix, including some degree of effacement and \\nslower progression of dilatation up to 5\\xa0cm for first and \\nsubsequent labours.\\n \" The active first stage is a period of time characterized \\nby regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial \\ndegree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical \\ndilatation from 5\\xa0cm until full dilatation for first and \\nsubsequent labours.\\nRecommended\\nDuration of the first \\nstage of labour\\n6. Women should be informed that a standard duration of \\nthe latent first stage has not yet been established and can \\nvary widely from one woman to another. However, the \\nduration of active first stage (from 5\\xa0cm until full cervical \\ndilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12\\xa0hours in \\nfirst labours, and usually does not extend beyond 10\\xa0hours \\nin subsequent labours.\\nRecommended'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 35}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n28\\nCare option  Recommendation Category of \\nrecommendation\\nFirst stage of labour\\nProgress of the first \\nstage of labour\\n7. For pregnant women with spontaneous labour onset, \\nthe cervical dilatation rate threshold of 1\\xa0cm/hour during \\nactive first stage (as depicted by the partograph alert \\nline) is inaccurate to identify women at risk of adverse \\nbirth outcomes and is therefore not recommended for \\nthis purpose.\\n8. A minimum cervical dilatation rate of 1\\xa0cm/hour \\nthroughout active first stage is unrealistically fast for \\nsome women and is therefore not recommended for \\nidentification of normal labour progression. A slower than \\n1\\xa0cm/hour cervical dilatation rate alone should not be a \\nroutine indication for obstetric intervention.\\n9. Labour may not naturally accelerate until a cervical \\ndilatation threshold of 5\\xa0cm is reached. Therefore, the use \\nof medical interventions to accelerate labour and birth \\n(such as oxytocin augmentation or caesarean section) \\nbefore this threshold is not recommended, provided that \\nfetal and maternal conditions are reassuring.\\nNot recommended\\nNot recommended\\nNot recommended\\nLabour ward \\nadmission policy\\n10. For healthy pregnant women presenting in spontaneous \\nlabour, a policy of delaying labour ward admission until \\nactive first stage is recommended only in the context of \\nrigorous research.\\nResearch-context \\nrecommendation\\nClinical pelvimetry on \\nadmission\\n11. Routine clinical pelvimetry on admission in labour is not \\nrecommended for healthy pregnant women.\\nNot recommended\\nRoutine assessment \\nof fetal well-being on \\nlabour admission\\n12. Routine cardiotocography is not recommended for the \\nassessment of fetal well-being on labour admission in \\nhealthy pregnant women presenting in spontaneous \\nlabour.\\n13. Auscultation using a Doppler ultrasound device or Pinard \\nfetal stethoscope is recommended for the assessment of \\nfetal well-being on labour admission.\\nNot recommended\\nRecommended\\nPerineal/pubic shaving 14. Routine perineal/pubic shaving prior to giving vaginal \\nbirth is not recommended.\\nNot recommended\\nEnema on admission 15. Administration of an enema for reducing the use of labour \\naugmentation is not recommended.\\nNot recommended\\nDigital vaginal \\nexamination\\n16.

A core review group \\n(see Acknowledgements) conducted a user survey to solicit feedback on \\nuse of the manual and suggestions to guide the revision.

The revised chapters were sent to an \\nexternal panel of expert reviewers (see Acknowledgements). The external \\nexperts were selected on the basis of their clinical experience in emergency \\nobstetric care in low- and middle-income countries. None of the external \\nreviewers reported any conflict of interest.  \\nThe core group met again in Geneva in January 2016 to review comments \\nfrom the external reviewers and to finalize the chapters. The finalized \\nchapters were then sent to the WHO’s Guidelines Review Committee for \\napproval. \\nMinor revisions, including clarification of wording and corrections  \\n(e.g. grammatical and typographical), have been made throughout the \\nmanual.

However, readers are referred to two recent WHO sources on \\nobstetric ultrasound: Chapter 2 in the Manual of Diagnostic Ultrasound, \\nSecond Edition (WHO, 2013) and WHO Recommendations on Antenatal \\nCare for a Positive Pregnancy Experience (WHO, 2016). The latter \\nrecommends one routine ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation.  \\n \\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION \\nIn support of the Safe Motherhood Initiative, the WHO Making Pregnancy \\nSafer Strategy focuses on the Health Sector’s contribution to reducing \\nmaternal and newborn deaths. \\nThe Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC) is the \\ntechnical component of the aforementioned strategy and mainly addresses \\nthe following: \\n• Improving the skills of health workers through locally adapted \\nguidelines and standards for the management of pregnancy and \\nchildbirth at different levels of the health care system; \\n• Interventions to improve the health care system’s response to the \\nneeds of pregnant women and their newborns, and to improve the \\ndistrict level management of health services, including the provision of \\nadequate staffing, logistics, supplies and equipment; \\n• Health education and promotion of activities that improve family and \\ncommunity attitudes and practices in relation to pregnancy and \\nchildbirth. \\nThis manual, and a similar one on the management of preterm and sick \\nnewborns, is written for midwives and doctors working in district \\nhospitals. This manual complements and is consistent with the Essential \\nCare Practice Guide for Pregnancy and Childbirth which is prepared \\nmainly for the primary health care level. Together these manuals will \\nprovide guidance for health workers who are responsible for the care of \\npregnant women and newborns at all levels of care. \\nThe interventions described in these manuals are based on the latest \\navailable scientific evidence. Given that evidence-based medicine is the \\nstandard on which to base clinical practice, it is planned to update the \\nmanual as new information is acquired. \\nIt is hoped that this manual will be used at the side of the patient, and be \\nreadily available whenever a midwife or doctor is confronted with an \\nobstetric emergency.

Around 15% of all pregnant women will develop a potentially  \\nlife-threatening complication that calls for skilled care, and some will \\nrequire a major obstetrical intervention to survive. This manual is written \\nfor midwives and doctors at the district hospital who are responsible for the \\ncare of women with complications of pregnancy, childbirth or the \\nimmediate postpartum period, including immediate problems of the \\nnewborn. \\nIn addition to providing care to women in facilities, midwives and doctors \\nhave a unique role and relationship with: \\n• the community of health care providers within the district \\nhealth system, including auxiliary and multipurpose health \\nworkers; \\n• family members of patients; \\n• community leaders; \\n• populations with special needs (e.g. adolescents, women with \\nHIV/AIDS). \\nMidwives and doctors: \\n• support activities for the improvement of all district health \\nservices; \\n• strive for efficient and reliable referral systems; \\n• monitor the quality of health care services; \\n• advocate for community participation in health-related \\nmatters. \\nA district hospital is defined as a facility that is capable of providing \\nquality services, including caesarean birth and blood transfusion. Although \\nmany of the procedures in this manual require specialized equipment and \\nthe expertise of specially trained providers, it should be noted that many of \\nthe life-saving procedures described can also be performed at health \\ncentres. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='xii Introduction \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=\"HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL xiii \\nA woman presenting with a life-threatening obstetric complication is in an \\nemergency situation requiring immediate diagnosis and management. \\nTherefore, the main text of this manual is arranged by symptom  \\n(e.g. vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy). Because this symptom-based \\napproach is different than most medical texts, which are arranged by \\ndisease, an indexed list of diagnoses is provided. \\nThe emphasis of the manual is on rapid assessment and decision making. \\nThe clinical action steps are based on clinical assessment, with limited \\nreliance on laboratory or other tests that would be unavailable in many \\nfield situations, and most are possible in a variety of clinical settings  \\n(e.g. district hospital or health centre). \\nSection 1 outlines the clinical principles of managing complications in \\npregnancy and childbirth. It begins with a table that the health care worker \\ncan use to rapidly assess the woman's condition and initiate appropriate \\ntreatment. This section includes the general principles of emergency, \\ngeneral and operative care, including infection prevention, the use of blood \\nand replacement fluids, antibiotics and anaesthesia and analgesia. In order \\nto provide health care workers with the information needed to differentiate \\nbetween normal processes and a complication, the section also includes a \\ndescription of normal labour and childbirth, including use of the \\npartograph and active management of the third stage. Guidance on the \\ninitial care of the normal newborn is also provided. Finally, this section \\nalso outlines the linkage between providers and their community and how \\nto provide emotional support to the woman and her family. \\nSection 2 describes the symptoms by which women with complications of \\npregnancy and childbirth present. The symptoms reflect the major causes \\nof mortality and morbidity. For each symptom there is a statement of \\ngeneral, initial management. Where relevant, diagnosis tables lead to \\nidentifying the diagnosis which is causing the symptom. Simplified \\nmanagement protocols for these specific diagnoses then follow. Where \\nthere are several choices of therapy, the most effective and inexpensive is \\nchosen. Also in this section is information on management for immediate \\n(within the first 24 hours) conditions or problems of the newborn. \\nSection 3 describes the procedures that may be necessary in the \\nmanagement of complications of pregnancy and childbirth. These \\nprocedures are not intended to be detailed “how-to” instructions but rather \\na summary of the main steps associated with each procedure. Because \\ngeneral operative care principles are summarized in Section 1, these are not \\nrepeated for each procedure, unless there is care required that is specific to \\nthe procedure (e.g. post-procedure care for ketamine anaesthesia). Clear \\nguidance is provided on drugs and dosages, a wide variety of anaesthesia \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='xiv How to Use This Manual \\noptions (e.g. safe caesarean under local anaesthesia) and safe, effective and \\nlower-cost techniques (e.g. single layer closure of the uterus). \\nA list of essential drugs is included as an appendix to the manual. Finally, \\nthe manual’s index is organized so that it can be used in an emergency \\nsituation to find relevant material quickly. The most critical information, \\nincluding diagnosis, management and steps for a procedure, is listed first in \\nbold. Other relevant entries follow in alphabetical order. Only the pages \\ncontaining critical or relevant information are included, rather than every \\npage that contains a word or phrase.

It can also be a time \\nof anxiety and concern. Listening and talking respectfully and sensitively \\nwith a woman and her family can help build the woman’s trust and \\nconfidence in her health care providers. \\nWomen who develop complications may have difficulty talking to the \\nprovider and explaining their problem. It is the responsibility of the entire \\nhealth care team to speak with the woman respectfully and put her at ease. \\nFocusing on the woman means that the health care provider and staff:  \\n• respect the woman’s dignity and right to privacy;  \\n• respect the woman’s right to information and informed consent;  \\n• respect the woman’s right to decline any treatment or procedures \\noffered;  \\n• respect the woman’s choices and preferences, including \\ncompanionship during maternity care, procedures and treatment; \\n• protect a woman’s privacy rights and protections with respect to her \\nhealth information, including how her health information is used and \\nto whom her information is disclosed by health care providers; \\n• are sensitive and responsive to the woman’s needs; \\n• are nonjudgmental about the decisions that the woman and her family \\nmake regarding the woman’s care. \\nIt is understandable to disagree with a woman’s risky behaviour or a \\ndecision that has resulted in a delay in seeking care. It is not acceptable, \\nhowever, to show disrespect for a woman or disregard for a medical \\ncondition that you believe is a result of her behaviour. Provide respectful \\ncorrective counselling after the complication has been dealt with, not \\nbefore or during management of the problem. \\n \\nRIGHTS OF WOMEN \\nProviders should be aware of the rights of women when receiving \\nmaternity care services: \\n• Every woman receiving care has the right to information about her \\nhealth. \\n• Every woman has the right to discuss her concerns in an environment \\nin which she feels confident. \\n• A woman should know in advance the type of procedure that is going \\nto be performed.

The concept \\nof safe motherhood is usually restricted to physical safety, but childbearing \\nis also an important rite of passage, which may have deep personal and \\ncultural significance for a woman and her family. The notion of safe \\nmotherhood must be expanded beyond the prevention of morbidity and \\nmortality to encompass respect for women’s basic human rights, including \\nwomen’s autonomy, dignity, feelings, and choices and preferences, \\nincluding the choice of companionship, wherever possible. \\n \\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNICATION AND \\nSUPPORT \\nEmergency situations are disturbing for all concerned, and they evoke a \\nrange of emotions that can have significant consequences. Because each \\nemergency is unique, this chapter offers general guidance for responding to \\nemotional and psychosocial needs in emergencies. Honest communication \\nand genuine empathy are probably the most important keys to effective \\ncare in such situations. In addition, health care staff must try to understand \\nand acknowledge the specific needs and cultural practices of individual \\nwomen and their families, including the potentially differing needs of \\nindividual family members.  \\nIn general, women need opportunities to talk about their pregnancy and \\nbirth experience(s) and to be reassured that they will be well cared for \\nduring pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Good \\ncommunication encompasses the following: an explanation of events; an \\nexplanation of findings and exploration of courses of action that will assist \\nthe woman in making informed decisions; an opportunity to discuss \\nfeelings such as loss, fear, anger and self-blame; social support; and a \\ndiscussion of possible future childbearing. \\n \\nEMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS \\nMultiple factors may influence women’s psychological status before, \\nduring and after pregnancy. A woman’s psychological status in turn \\ninfluences her ability to care for herself and her baby and to follow health \\ncare recommendations. Therefore, to achieve optimal outcomes, it is as  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='C-10 Emotional and psychological support \\nimportant to provide emotional and psychological support as it is to \\nprovide medical care. \\nCommon reactions to an obstetric/newborn emergency or death include: \\n• denial (feelings that “it can’t be true”); \\n• guilt regarding possible responsibility; \\n• anger (frequently directed toward health care staff but often masking \\nanger that parents direct at themselves for “failure”); \\n• blame, fear, anxiety, sorrow, grief and a sense of failure; \\n• bargaining (particularly if the woman/baby hovers for a while between \\nlife and death); \\n• depression and loss of self-esteem, which may be long-lasting; \\n• isolation (feelings of being different or separate from others), which \\nmay be reinforced by caregivers who might avoid people who \\nexperience loss; and disorientation. \\nHow each member of the family reacts to an emergency situation depends \\non:  \\n• the woman’s support systems, including her relationship with her \\npartner and the presence of family or supportive individuals; \\n• the social situation of the woman/couple and their cultural and \\nreligious practices, beliefs and expectations; \\n• the woman’s previous pregnancy outcomes, chronic medical problems \\nand history of psychiatric problems, sexual and domestic abuse, or \\nsubstance abuse; \\n• the personalities of the people involved and the quality and nature of \\nsocial, practical and emotional support; and \\n• the nature, gravity and prognosis of the problem and the availability \\nand quality of health care services. \\nAwareness and recognition of these factors can help maternal health care \\nproviders better support women and their families. Failure to recognize \\nrisk factors and/or psychological distress in pregnant and postpartum \\nwomen can have devastating and tragic consequences for the woman and \\nher child(ren) and family.

Do not pass this responsibility on to \\njunior staff. \\n• At the onset of the event, it is helpful to advise the woman and her \\nfamily that:  \\n- in order to address the emergency, the providers need to quickly \\nassess and treat the complication; \\n- the providers will provide pertinent information while they are \\nproviding care; \\n- after the emergency, the providers will be able to speak in more \\ndetail. \\n• Listen to those who are distressed. The woman/family will need to \\nexpress their hurt and sorrow.  \\n• Do not change the subject and move on to easier or less painful topics \\nof conversation. Show empathy. \\n• Tell the woman/family as much as you can about what is happening. \\nOften a simple explanation and understanding the situation and \\nknowing what to expect can reduce their anxiety and prepare them for \\nwhat happens next.  \\n• Be honest.

Many \\nwomen/families blame themselves for what has happened. \\n• Listen and express understanding and acceptance of the woman’s \\nfeelings. Nonverbal communication may speak louder than words: A \\nsqueeze of the hand or a look of concern can say an enormous amount. \\n• Repeat information several times and give written information, if \\npossible. People experiencing an emergency will not remember much \\nof what is said to them. \\n• Remember to care for staff who themselves may experience guilt, \\ngrief, confusion and other emotions. Provide supportive services for \\nhealth care providers as a way to relieve anxiety and distress. Health \\ncare providers may feel anger, guilt, sorrow, pain and frustration in the \\nface of obstetric emergencies, which might lead them to avoid the \\nwoman/family.

It is also devastating for all involved in her care. In \\naddition to the principles listed above, remember the following: \\nAT THE TIME OF THE EVENT \\n• Provide psychological care as long as the woman is awake or even \\nvaguely aware of what is or might be happening to her. \\n• If death is inevitable, provide emotional and spiritual comfort rather \\nthan focusing on the emergency (now futile) medical care. \\n• Provide dignity and respectful treatment at all times, even if the \\nwoman is unconscious or has already died. \\n \\nAFTER THE EVENT \\n• Allow the woman’s partner or family to be with her.  \\n• Facilitate the family’s arrangements for the funeral, if possible, and \\nsee that they have all the necessary documents. \\n• Explain what happened and answer any questions.

It typically occurs in \\nthe early postpartum weeks or months and may persist for a year or more. \\nDepression is not necessarily one of the leading symptoms, although it is \\nusually evident. Other symptoms include exhaustion, irritability, \\nweepiness, low energy and motivational levels, feelings of helplessness \\nand hopelessness, loss of libido, and appetite and sleep disturbances. \\nHeadache, asthma, backache, vaginal discharge and abdominal pain may \\nbe reported. Symptoms might also include obsessional thinking, fear of \\nharming the baby or self, suicidal thoughts, and depersonalization.  \\nThe prognosis for postpartum depression is good with early diagnosis and \\ntreatment. More than two thirds of women recover within a year. \\nFacilitating the presence of a companion of choice during pregnancy, \\nlabour, childbirth and the postpartum period may help prevent postpartum \\ndepression.  \\nWomen should routinely be screened for depression during postpartum \\nvisits: \\n• At each postnatal contact, women should be asked about their \\nemotional well-being, what family and social support they have, and \\ntheir usual coping strategies for dealing with day-to-day matters. All \\nwomen and their families/partners should be encouraged to tell their \\nhealth care professional about any changes in mood, emotional state or \\nbehaviour that are outside the woman’s normal pattern.  \\n• At 10–14 days after birth, all women should be asked about resolution \\nof mild, transitory postpartum depression (“maternal blues”/“baby \\nblues”). If symptoms have not resolved, the woman’s psychological \\nwell-being should continue to be assessed for postnatal depression \\nand, if symptoms persist, further evaluated. \\nWomen who screen positive for postnatal depression should be linked to \\nongoing care, including further diagnostic evaluation and ongoing \\ntreatment as indicated. In addition, surveillance for maternal depression \\ncan be performed at pediatric visits in the first 12 months postpartum.  \\nRisk factors for postpartum depression include: \\n• Previous postpartum depression; \\n• Active or previous mental illness; \\n• Being a member of a vulnerable population; \\n• Traumatic childbirth; '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='Emotional and psychological support  C-19 \\n• Giving birth to a preterm or stillborn infant or experiencing the death \\nof a newborn; \\n• Having an infant admitted to intensive care; \\n• History of being a neglected child. \\nOnce established, postpartum depression requires psychological \\ncounselling and ongoing practical support. In general: \\n• Psychosocial interventions should be the first line of management of \\ndepression during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Antidepressant \\nmedication should be avoided as much as possible in this population. \\n• Listen to the woman and provide encouragement. \\n• Incorporate general principles of care: provide empathic, clear and \\nsensitive communication with women and their families, and mobilize \\nand provide social support. \\n• Assure the woman that the experience is fairly common; many other \\nwomen experience the same thing and most women are able to \\nrecover. \\n• Provide psycho-education and avoid over-medicalization. To avoid \\nstigma, use commonly understood terms such as stress and burden \\ninstead of depressive disorder or illness. \\n• Assist the woman in rethinking her image of motherhood, and assist \\nthe couple in thinking through their respective roles as new parents. \\nThey may need to adjust their expectations and activities. \\n• Provide adjunct treatments such as structured physical activity, \\nrelaxation and problem-solving, if available, and integrate these \\nactivities into the woman’s daily routine. \\n• Facilitate social support for the woman throughout the intervention. \\n• Give attention to the woman’s overall well-being, attending to her \\nphysical as well as psychological health and emphasizing the \\nimportance of the mother-infant relationship in this period. \\n• Provide practical help (with the baby and with home care). \\n• If depression is severe, women may benefit from treatment with an \\nantidepressant medication.

Local support groups of women who have had similar \\nexperiences can be valuable for many women.  \\n \\nPOSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS \\nPostpartum psychosis typically occurs around the time of childbirth, most \\noften within the first two weeks postpartum, and affects less than 1% of \\nwomen. Severe postpartum depression may be associated with psychosis. \\nSymptoms of postpartum psychosis include delusions, hallucinations, sleep \\ndisturbances, obsessive thoughts about the baby, severe depression, \\nanxiety, despair, and suicidal or infanticidal impulses. Women who have \\nbipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder have a higher risk of \\ndeveloping postpartum psychosis. About half of women experiencing \\npostpartum psychosis have a history of mental illness.  \\nThe prognosis for recovery is excellent, but about 50% of women will \\nsuffer a relapse with subsequent births. Postpartum psychosis is a mental \\nhealth emergency and requires immediate attention to prevent the woman \\nfrom harming herself or her baby. In general: \\n• Immediately seek comprehensive psychiatric and medical care. \\n• A woman with active psychosis should not care for her infant “as \\nusual.” Arrangements should be made for supplemental care to ensure \\nthe safety of the newborn. \\n• Family members should remain with the woman at all times.  \\n• Often, hospitalization is required for women with postpartum \\npsychosis. \\n• Provide psychological support and arrange for practical help with the \\nbaby and with home care, including measures to ensure that the baby \\nremains safe until the psychosis has resolved. \\n• Listen to the woman and provide support for her and her family, \\nincluding linkages for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment, as \\nindicated. This is important for avoiding tragic outcomes. \\n• Lessen stress.  \\n• Avoid dealing with emotional issues when the woman is unstable.  \\n• If antipsychotic medications are used, be aware that medication can \\nbe passed through breastmilk, so decisions about treatment must take \\ninto consideration and address a woman’s breastfeeding status.

It is important to use \\nblood, blood products and replacement fluids appropriately and to be \\naware of the principles designed to assist health workers in deciding when \\n(and when not) to transfuse. \\nThe appropriate use of blood products is defined as the transfusion of safe \\nblood products to treat a condition leading to significant morbidity or \\nmortality that cannot be prevented or managed effectively by other means. \\nConditions that might require blood transfusion include: \\n• postpartum haemorrhage leading to shock; \\n• loss of a large volume of blood at operative birth; and \\n• severe anaemia, especially in later pregnancy or if accompanied by \\ncardiac failure. \\nNote: For anaemia in early pregnancy, treat the cause of anaemia and \\nprovide haematinics. \\nDistrict hospitals should be prepared for the urgent need for blood \\ntransfusion.

When there is sudden rapid loss of blood due to \\nhaemorrhage, surgery or complications of childbirth, the most urgent need \\nis usually the rapid replacement of the fluid lost from circulation. \\nBlood that has not been obtained from appropriately selected donors \\nand that has not been screened for transfusion-transmissible \\ninfectious agents (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) in accordance with national \\nrequirements should not be issued for transfusion, other than in the \\nmost exceptional life-threatening situations.

It will cause \\nhaemolysis and will probably be fatal. \\nSAFETY \\nBefore giving any IV infusion: \\n• check that the seal of the infusion bottle or bag is not broken; \\n• check the expiry date; \\n• check that the solution is clear and free of visible particles. \\nDextrose (glucose) solutions are poor replacement fluids. Do not use \\nthem to treat hypovolaemia unless there is no other alternative. \\nThere is a very limited role for colloids in resuscitation.

If it is anticipated that the woman will receive IV \\nfluids for 48 hours or more, infuse a balanced electrolyte solution  \\n(e.g. potassium chloride 1.5 g in 1 L IV fluids) with dextrose.

In general, antibiotics that have been \\nassociated with a significant prior allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) \\nshould not be given unless under the close supervision of a trained \\nphysician. However, if the reported antibiotic allergic reaction was mild \\n(e.g. rash) and did not involve systemic symptoms, then it is reasonable, if \\nother options do not exist, to give a carefully supervised trial of the \\nantibiotic. In general, there is up to a 10% chance that a woman with a \\nprior allergic reaction to penicillin may have an allergic reaction to a \\ncephalosporin. \\n \\nANAPHYLAXIS  \\nAnaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that depends on rapid \\nand timely management.  \\n• Symptoms of anaphylaxis can include:  \\n- a sense of tingling  \\n- flushing  \\n- swelling of the face, lips and tongue  \\n- difficulty breathing due to swelling of the throat and airway  \\n- shortness of breath  \\n- abdominal cramps  \\n- palpitations  \\n- syncope  \\n• Administer adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mg IM immediately, and repeat every \\n10 to 15 minutes, as needed.

Supportive care during labour provides reassurance \\nand decreases the perception of pain (page C-86). \\n• If a woman is distressed by pain, encourage her to walk around or \\nassume any comfortable position. Encourage her companion to \\nmassage her back or sponge her face between contractions. Encourage \\nthe use of breathing techniques and allow the woman to take a warm \\nbath or shower if she chooses. For most women, this is enough to cope \\nwith the pain of labour. If necessary, offer the woman: \\n- morphine 0.1 mg/kg body weight IM every four hours as needed, \\ninforming her of the advantages and disadvantages (see below) \\nand obtaining consent; \\n- promethazine 25 mg IM or IV if vomiting occurs. \\n \\n \\nDANGER \\nIf morphine is given to the woman within four hours before she gives \\nbirth, the baby may suffer from respiratory depression. Naloxone is the \\nantidote. \\nNote: Do not administer naloxone to newborns whose mothers are \\nsuspected of having recently abused narcotic drugs. \\n• If there are signs of respiratory depression in the newborn, begin \\nresuscitation immediately: \\n- After vital signs have been established, give naloxone 0.1 mg/kg \\nbody weight IV to the newborn.  \\n- If the infant has adequate peripheral circulation after \\nsuccessful resuscitation, naloxone can be given IM. Repeated \\ndoses may be required to prevent recurrent respiratory depression. \\nBarbiturates and sedatives should not be used to relieve anxiety in \\nlabour.

The dose must be adjusted to the weight and condition of the \\nwoman and to the condition of the fetus (when present). Inform the woman \\nof the advantages and disadvantages, and obtain consent. \\n• Offer morphine 0.1 mg/kg body weight IM, informing the woman of \\nthe advantages and disadvantages (page C-55) and obtaining consent. \\n• Give diazepam in increments of 1 mg IV and wait at least two minutes \\nbefore giving another increment.

Its use with lidocaine has the \\nfollowing advantages: \\n• less blood loss; \\n• longer effect of anaesthetic (usually one to two hours); and \\n• less risk of toxicity because of slower absorption into the general \\ncirculation. \\nIf the procedure requires a small surface to be anaesthetized or \\nrequires less than 40 mL of lidocaine, adrenaline is not necessary.

Women who are comfortable during a procedure are less \\nlikely to move and cause injury to themselves. Pain management can \\ninclude: \\n• emotional support and encouragement \\n• local anaesthesia \\n• regional anaesthesia (e.g. spinal) \\n• general anaesthesia. \\n \\nANTIBIOTICS \\n• Give prophylactic antibiotics before starting the procedure  \\n(page C-50).  \\n \\nMAKING THE INCISION \\n• When choosing the incision type, carefully consider the woman’s past \\nsurgical history, the indication for surgery, and potential technical \\ndifficulties and complications. For example, for an obstructed labour \\ncase with Bandl’s ring formation, a sub-umbilical midline incision \\nmay be preferable to a Pfannenstiel’s incision. \\n• Make the incision only as large as necessary for the procedure. \\n• Make the incision with great care and proceed one layer at a time. \\n \\nHANDLING TISSUE \\n• Handle tissue gently. \\n• When using clamps, close the clamp only one ratchet (click), when \\npossible. This will minimize discomfort and reduce the amount of \\ndead tissue that remains behind at the end of the procedure, thus \\ndecreasing the risk of infection. \\n \\nHAEMOSTASIS \\nHaemostasis is the process in which blood is maintained in a fluid state and \\nconfined to the vascular system.

Therefore, \\nkeep blood loss to a minimum. \\n \\nINSTRUMENTS AND SHARPS \\n• Start and finish the procedure with a count of instruments, sharps and \\nsponges: \\n- Perform the count every time a body cavity (e.g. uterus) is closed; \\n- Document in the woman’s record that the surgical counts were \\ncorrect.  \\n• Use instruments, especially sharps, carefully to reduce the risk of \\ninjury (page C-32). Use “safe zones” when handling and passing \\ninstruments and sharps: \\n- Use a pan such as a kidney basin to carry and pass sharp items, \\nand pass suture needles on a needle holder. \\n- Alternatively, pass the instrument with the handle, rather than the \\nsharp end, pointing toward the receiver. \\n \\nDRAINAGE \\n• Always leave an abdominal drain in place if: \\n- bleeding persists after hysterectomy; \\n- a clotting disorder is suspected; \\n- infection is present or suspected; or \\n- a bladder or ureteral injury is suspected or has been identified and \\nrepaired. \\n• A closed drainage system can be used, or a corrugated rubber drain \\ncan be placed through the abdominal wall or pouch of Douglas. \\n• Remove the drain once the infection has cleared or when no pus or \\nblood-stained fluid has drained for 48 hours. \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='Operative care principles C-71 \\nSUTURE \\n• Select the appropriate type and size of suture for the tissue  \\n(Table C-7).

Prolonged infusion of IV fluids can alter \\nelectrolyte balance.  \\n- Whenever a woman is receiving IV fluids, monitor her intake and \\noutput closely.  \\n• Ensure that the woman is eating a regular diet before discharge from \\nthe hospital. \\n \\nDRESSING AND WOUND CARE \\nThe dressing is a protective barrier against infection while a healing \\nprocess known as “re-epithelialization” occurs. Keep the dressing on the \\nwound for the first day after surgery to protect against infection while  \\nre-epithelialization occurs. Thereafter, a dressing is not necessary. \\n• If blood or fluid is leaking through the initial dressing, do not \\nchange the dressing: \\n- Reinforce the dressing. \\n- Monitor the amount of blood/fluid lost by outlining the blood \\nstain on the dressing with a pen. \\n- If bleeding increases or the blood stain covers half the \\ndressing or more, remove the dressing and inspect the wound. \\nReplace with another sterile dressing. \\n• If the dressing comes loose, reinforce with more tape rather than \\nremoving the dressing. This will help maintain the sterility of the \\ndressing and reduce the risk of wound infection. \\n• Change the dressing using sterile technique. \\n• The wound should be clean and dry, without evidence of infection or \\nseroma, before the woman’s discharge from the hospital.  \\n \\nANALGESIA \\nAdequate postoperative pain control is important (page C-55).

Early catheter \\nremoval reduces the risk of infection and encourages the woman to walk.  \\n• If the urine is clear, remove the catheter eight hours after surgery or \\nafter the first postoperative night. \\n• If the urine is not clear, leave the catheter in place until the urine is \\nclear. \\n• Wait 48 hours after surgery before removing the catheter if there was: \\n- uterine rupture \\n- prolonged or obstructed labour \\n- massive perineal oedema \\n- puerperal sepsis with pelvic peritonitis. \\nNote: Ensure that the urine is clear before removing the catheter. \\n• If the bladder was injured (from either uterine rupture or during \\ncaesarean or laparotomy): \\n- Leave the catheter in place for a minimum of seven days and until \\nthe urine is clear. \\n- If the woman is not currently receiving antibiotics, give \\nnitrofurantoin 100 mg by mouth once daily until the catheter is \\nremoved, for prophylaxis against cystitis. \\n- If there is a suspicion of a bladder injury (e.g. the woman has \\nhad prolonged obstructed labour), consider leaving the catheter in \\nfor seven days.  \\n \\nANTIBIOTICS  \\n• If there were signs of infection or the woman currently has a fever, \\ncontinue antibiotics until the woman is fever-free for 48 hours (page \\nC-49). \\nSUTURE REMOVAL \\nMajor support for abdominal incisions comes from the closure of the \\nfascial layer.

Types of abortion \\nSpontaneous abortion is defined as the loss of a pregnancy before fetal viability (22 \\nweeks of gestation). The stages of spontaneous abortion may include: \\n• threatened abortion (pregnancy may continue); \\n• inevitable abortion (pregnancy will not continue and will proceed to \\nincomplete/complete abortion); \\n• incomplete abortion (products of conception are partially expelled); \\n• complete abortion (products of conception are completely expelled).  \\n \\nInduced abortion is defined as a process by which pregnancy is terminated before \\nfetal viability. \\nUnsafe abortion is defined as a procedure performed either by persons lacking \\nnecessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.  \\nSeptic abortion is defined as abortion complicated by infection. Sepsis may result \\nfrom infection if organisms rise from the lower genital tract following either \\nspontaneous or unsafe abortion. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there are retained \\nproducts of conception and evacuation has been delayed. Sepsis is a frequent \\ncomplication of unsafe abortion involving instrumentation. \\n \\nSPECIFIC MANAGEMENT \\nIf unsafe abortion is suspected, examine for signs of infection or uterine, vaginal \\nor bowel injury (Table S-2, page S-9), and thoroughly irrigate the vagina to \\nremove any herbs, local medications or caustic substances. \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 154}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-11 \\n \\nTHREATENED ABORTION \\n• Medical treatment is usually not necessary.  \\n• Advise the woman to avoid strenuous activity and sexual intercourse, \\nbut bed rest is not necessary. \\n• If bleeding stops, follow up in an antenatal clinic.

Managing inevitable and incomplete abortion \\n• In cases of inevitable and incomplete abortion, surgical evacuation and medical or \\nexpectant management are all reasonable management options. To determine the \\nbest course of action, one must take the following into consideration: \\n– the urgency of the particular case (i.e. haemodynamic stability); \\n– the skill set of the available providers and staff; \\n– the health facility setting and available materials, supplies and medications; \\nand \\n– the woman’s preference, after complete counselling on options.  \\n• Evacuation: If evacuation is appropriate and the woman prefers surgical \\nmanagement, examine the woman to determine if products of conception are \\nvisible in the os or the vagina and remove them with sponge or ring forceps. If \\nproducts are not visible, proceed with manual vacuum aspiration if gestational \\nage is less than 12–14 weeks (page P-75). Proceed with dilatation and evacuation \\n(D and E) (page S-18) if gestational age is more than 12–14 weeks and the \\nmajority of the products remain in the uterus. \\n• Medical Management: If medical management is determined to be appropriate \\n(i.e. the woman is haemodynamically stable and ectopic pregnancy is not \\nsuspected), and it is the woman’s preference, proceed with a medical protocol.  \\n- See Table S-4 (page S-13) for medical management protocols. Optimal \\ndoses for misoprostol in the setting of incomplete abortion have not been \\ndetermined. However, a reasonable protocol can be found in the \\nmanagement table. \\n- If misoprostol is not available, oxytocin is an option for medical \\nmanagement after 16 weeks.  \\n- If expulsion of products of conception is not achieved, proceed to \\nsurgical evacuation.  \\n- Ensure follow-up of the woman after treatment (page S-14). \\n• Expectant Management: Expectant management is a reasonable option if the \\nwoman is haemodynamically stable and prefers to avoid surgical or medical \\nintervention. \\n– Await spontaneous expulsion of products of conception. \\n– If spontaneous expulsion does not occur in a reasonable timeframe, \\ndepending on the woman’s tolerance for the discomfort and wait and her \\nhaemodynamic status, proceed to either medical management or evacuation \\nof the uterus via manual vacuum aspiration (page P-75) or D and E (page \\nS-18). \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 156}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-13 \\n \\nTABLE S-4.

Reassure her that the chances \\nfor a subsequent successful pregnancy are good unless there has been \\nsepsis or a cause of the abortion is identified that may have an adverse \\neffect on future pregnancies (this is rare). \\nSome women may want to become pregnant soon after having an abortion. \\nThey should be encouraged to delay the next pregnancy until they have \\ncompletely recovered. \\nAbortion care should always include comprehensive contraceptive \\ncounselling with initiation of the method of choice as soon as desired after \\nthe abortion.  \\nBefore the desired method is initiated, women should be assessed for \\nmedical eligibility (see WHO, Medical Eligibility Criteria for \\nContraceptive Use, 5th ed., 2015).  \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-15 \\n \\nTABLE S-6.

The fallopian tube is the most common site of ectopic \\nimplantation (greater than 90%). \\nSymptoms and signs are extremely variable, depending on whether or not \\nthe pregnancy has ruptured (Table S-7, page S-16). Culdocentesis  \\n(cul-de-sac puncture, page P-81) is an important tool for the diagnosis of \\nruptured ectopic pregnancy, but it is less useful than a serum pregnancy \\ntest combined with ultrasonography. If nonclotting blood is obtained, \\nbegin immediate management.

Symptoms and signs of unruptured and ruptured ectopic \\npregnancy \\nUnruptured Ectopic Pregnancy Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy \\n• Symptoms of early pregnancy (irregular \\nspotting or bleeding, nausea, swelling of \\nbreasts, bluish discolouration of vagina \\nand cervix, softening of cervix, slight \\nuterine enlargement, increased urinary \\nfrequency) \\n• Abdominal and pelvic pain \\n• Collapse and weakness \\n• Fast, weak pulse (110 beats per minute \\nor more) \\n• Hypotension \\n• Hypovolaemia \\n• Acute abdominal and pelvic pain \\n• Abdominal distensiona \\n• Rebound tenderness \\n• Pallor \\na A distended abdomen with shifting dullness may indicate free blood. \\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \\nThe most common differential diagnosis for ectopic pregnancy is \\nthreatened abortion. Others are acute or chronic pelvic inflammatory \\ndisease, ovarian cysts (torsion or rupture), and acute appendicitis. \\nIf available, ultrasound can help to distinguish a threatened abortion or \\ntwisted ovarian cyst from an ectopic pregnancy. \\n \\nIMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT \\n• Cross-match blood and arrange for immediate laparotomy. Do not \\nwait for blood before performing surgery. \\n• At surgery, inspect both ovaries and fallopian tubes: \\n- If there is extensive damage to the tube, perform salpingectomy \\n(the bleeding tube and the products of conception are removed \\ntogether). This is the treatment of choice in most cases (page  \\nP-131).  \\n- Rarely, if there is little tubal damage, perform salpingostomy \\n(the products of conception can be removed and the tube \\nconserved). Because the risk of another ectopic pregnancy is high, \\nthis should be done only when the conservation of fertility is very \\nimportant to the woman (page P-131). \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-17 \\n \\nAutotransfusion \\nIf significant haemorrhage occurs, autotransfusion can be used if the \\nblood is unquestionably fresh and free of infection (in later stages of \\npregnancy, blood is contaminated [e.g. with amniotic fluid] and should not \\nbe used for autotransfusion). The blood can be collected before surgery or \\nafter the abdomen is opened: \\n• When the woman is on the operating table before surgery and the \\nabdomen is distended with blood, it is sometimes possible to insert a \\nneedle through the abdominal wall and collect the blood in a donor set.  \\n• Alternatively, open the abdomen: \\n- Scoop the blood into a basin and strain through gauze to remove \\nclots.  \\n- Clean the top portion of a blood donor bag with antiseptic solution \\nand open it with a sterile blade.  \\n- Pour the woman’s blood into the bag and reinfuse it through a \\nfiltered set in the usual way. \\n- If a donor bag with anticoagulant is not available, add sodium \\ncitrate 10 mL to each 90 mL of blood. \\n \\nSUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT \\n• Before discharge, provide counselling and advice on prognosis for \\nfertility. Given the increased risk of a future ectopic pregnancy, family \\nplanning counselling and provision of a family planning method, if \\ndesired, is especially important (Table S-6, page S-15). \\n• Correct anaemia with ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate 60 mg by \\nmouth daily for three months. \\n• Schedule a follow-up visit at four weeks.  \\n \\nMOLAR PREGNANCY \\nMolar pregnancy is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of chorionic \\nvilli. \\n \\nIMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT \\n• If the diagnosis of molar pregnancy is certain, cross-match blood if \\npossible and arrange for evacuation of the uterus: '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='S-18  Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy \\n- If cervical dilatation is needed, use a paracervical block (page \\nP-1). \\n- Use vacuum aspiration (page P-75). Manual vacuum aspiration is \\nsafer and associated with less blood loss than sharp metal \\ncurettage. The risk of perforation using the metal curette is high. \\n- Have three syringes prepared and ready for use during the \\nevacuation. The uterine contents are copious and it is important to \\nevacuate them rapidly. \\n• Infuse oxytocin 20 units in 1 L IV fluids (normal saline or Ringer’s \\nlactate) at a rate of 60 drops per minute to prevent haemorrhage once \\nevacuation is under way. \\n \\nSUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT \\n• Recommend a hormonal family planning method for at least one year \\nto prevent pregnancy (Table S-6, page S-15). Voluntary tubal ligation \\nmay be offered if the woman has completed her family. \\n• Follow up every eight weeks for at least one year with urine pregnancy \\ntests because of the risk of persistent trophoblastic disease or \\nchoriocarcinoma. Assess the woman for irregular bleeding through a \\nhistory and physical examination. If the urine pregnancy test is not \\nnegative after eight weeks or if it becomes positive again within the \\nfirst year, urgently refer the woman to a tertiary care centre for further \\nfollow-up and management of choriocarcinoma. \\n \\nDILATATION AND EVACUATION PROCEDURE  \\nAfter 14 weeks, a manual vacuum aspiration procedure and cannula might \\nnot be sufficient to evacuate the remaining intrauterine contents. In this \\ncase, it is necessary to use a heavy forceps to complete the evacuation.  \\n• Follow the manual vacuum aspiration procedure steps through \\nplacement of the tenaculum or vulsellum forceps.  \\n• Leave the tenaculum or vulsellum forceps in place on the anterior lip \\nof the cervix, or replace the forceps with a ring or sponge forceps if \\nthe tenaculum appears to be tearing the cervix.  \\n• Use graduated dilators to further dilate the cervix if the forceps do not \\npass easily through the cervix (page P-71).  \\n• Take care not to tear the cervix.

This may require multiple passes with the forceps.  \\nNote: The uterus is very soft in pregnancy and can easily be injured during the \\nprocedure. It is important that the operator understands the depth of the uterus and \\nthat the uterus will contract and the depth will decrease as the contents are \\nremoved. \\n• When all of the remaining fetal parts and placenta are removed, pass the \\nmanual vacuum aspiration cannula once more to ensure a gritty sensation \\nthroughout the uterus.  \\n• Evaluate all of the removed contents to ensure that all fetal parts are \\nidentified. Send the contents to histopathology if available and applicable.  \\n• Remove the tenaculum and ensure haemostasis at the puncture sites.  \\n• Assess the cervix for bleeding and tears.  \\n• If no tears are identified and bleeding is minimal, remove the speculum \\nand perform a bimanual exam to check the uterus for size and firmness.  \\n• Follow recommended post-procedure care (page P-73). \\n \\nAnti-D Immunoglobulin \\nIn settings where the prevalence of Rh-negative status is high and Rh-immunoglobulin \\nis routinely provided to Rh-negative women, administration of anti-D immunoglobulin \\nshould occur at the time of management of the abortion or ectopic or molar pregnancy. \\nThe dose of Rh-immunoglobulin may be reduced from 300 mcg (the dose used after a \\nterm birth) to 50 mcg in pregnancies less than 12 weeks duration.

Other conditions that may cause convulsions or coma \\ninclude:  \\n• epilepsy \\n• complicated malaria  \\n• head injury  \\n• meningitis  \\n• encephalitis. \\n(See Table S-12, page S-52 for more information on the differential \\ndiagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy). \\n \\nBLOOD PRESSURE \\nDiagnose hypertension in pregnancy if on two consecutive readings taken \\nfour hours or more apart:  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/(WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 194}, page_content='Elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred vision, convulsions or loss of consciousness  S-51 \\n \\n• systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or higher and/or  \\n• diastolic blood pressure is 90 mmHg or higher. \\nNote: Blood pressure is in the severe range if the systolic blood pressure \\nis 160 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or \\nhigher. \\nIf hypertension occurs for the first time after 20 weeks of gestation, \\nduring labour and/or within 48 hours of giving birth, it is gestational \\nhypertension, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, depending on the presence of \\nother features (see Table S-12, page S-52). \\nIf hypertension occurs before 20 weeks of gestation, it is most likely \\nchronic hypertension. Because some women’s blood pressure might not be \\nmeasured before 20 weeks of gestation, chronic hypertension may be \\nidentified for the first time during pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation. \\nChronic hypertension will persist beyond 12 weeks postpartum. \\n \\nPROTEINURIA \\nThe presence of proteinuria changes the diagnosis from gestational \\nhypertension to pre-eclampsia. Because vaginal secretions or amniotic \\nfluid may contaminate a urine specimen, only clean-catch midstream \\nspecimens should be used. Catheterization for this purpose is not justified \\ndue to the risk of urinary tract infection. \\nDiagnostic criteria for proteinuria include: two urine dipstick \\nmeasurements of at least 2+ (30 mg per dL) taken six hours apart; at least \\n300 mg of protein in a 24-hour urine sample; or a urinary protein/creatinine \\nratio of 0.3 or greater. \\nIt is important to rule out pre-eclampsia before assigning another etiology \\nfor the presence of proteinuria in a pregnant woman with elevated blood \\npressure. However, other conditions can cause proteinuria and false \\npositive results are possible. Urinary tract infection, severe anaemia, heart \\nfailure and difficult labour may all cause proteinuria. Blood in the urine \\ndue to catheter trauma or schistosomiasis and contamination from vaginal \\nblood can give false positive results. \\nRandom urine sampling, such as the dipstick test for protein, is a useful \\nscreening tool. A change from negative to positive during pregnancy is a \\nwarning sign. If dipsticks are not available, a sample of urine can be heated \\nto boiling in a clean test tube. Add a drop of 2% acetic acid to check for \\npersistent precipitates that can be quantified as a percentage of protein to \\nthe volume of the total sample.

Once symptoms consistent with severe  \\npre-eclampsia begin, expectant management is not recommended.  \\n \\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT  \\n• Start an IV infusion and infuse IV fluids (page C-34).  \\n• Administer magnesium sulfate (page S-58).

In \\nearly pregnancy avoid drugs that are associated with congenital \\nmalformations (e.g. valproic acid). \\nWhen the mother has active immunity, the antibodies pass through the placenta, \\nprotecting the newborn. A woman is considered protected when she has received \\ntwo vaccine doses at least four weeks apart, with an interval of at least four weeks \\nbetween the last vaccine dose and pregnancy termination. Women who last received \\na vaccination series (five injections) more than 10 years before the present \\npregnancy should be given a booster. In most women a booster is recommended in \\nevery pregnancy. \\n \\nIf an immunized woman has had an unsafe abortion or unhygienic birth (or birth \\nattended by an unskilled attendant), give her a booster injection of tetanus toxoid \\n0.5 mL IM. If she has not been immunized before, give her antitetanus serum \\n1500 units IM and a booster injection of tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL IM after four weeks.

If facilities for measuring glucose are not \\navailable, consider empirical treatment with glucose. \\n• If there are clinical signs suggestive of associated sepsis or meningitis, \\ncentral nervous system infection should be ruled out by doing a \\nlumbar puncture.

Water will distend the posterior fornix \\nof the vagina gradually so that it stretches. This causes the \\ncircumference of the orifice to increase, relieves cervical constriction \\nand results in correction of the inversion. \\n \\nMANUAL CORRECTION UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHESIA \\n• If hydrostatic correction is not successful, try manual repositioning \\nunder general anaesthesia using halothane.

To open the abdomen: \\n- Make a midline vertical incision below the umbilicus to the pubic \\nhair, through the skin and to the level of the fascia. \\n- Make a 2–3 cm vertical incision in the fascia. \\n- Hold the fascial edge with forceps and lengthen the incision up \\nand down using scissors. \\n- Use fingers or scissors to separate the rectus muscles (abdominal \\nwall muscles). \\n- Use fingers to make an opening in the peritoneum near the \\numbilicus. Use scissors to lengthen the incision up and down in \\norder to see the entire uterus. Carefully, to prevent bladder injury, \\nuse scissors to separate layers and open the lower part of the \\nperitoneum. \\n- Place a bladder retractor over the pubic bone and place  \\nself-retaining abdominal retractors.  \\n• If the birth was by caesarean, clamp the sites of bleeding along the \\nuterine incision: \\n- In case of massive bleeding, have an assistant press fingers over \\nthe aorta in the lower abdomen.

Rates of maternal mortality are significantly higher for non-Hispanic Black people than non-\\nHispanic white and Hispanic people,4 and the rate of pregnancy-related mortality among non-Hispanic \\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native people is twice that of non-Hispanic white people.3 Recent data show \\npregnancy-related mortality ratios among non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders are \\nthe highest among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.3 \\nImproving access to high-quality health care is critical to addressing the leading causes of preventable \\nsevere maternal morbidity (SMM) and mortality in the United States. The Alliance for Innovation \\non Maternal Health (AIM) at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), \\nwhich is funded through a cooperative agreement with the Health Resources Services Administration, \\ndeveloped this Obstetric Emergency Readiness Resource kit in response to this need.  \\nThe AIM Obstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit contains best practices, resources, and planning \\nmaterials that can be used by teams in healthcare settings where obstetric services are not typically \\nprovided to appropriately prepare to care for pregnant and postpartum people experiencing \\nobstetric emergencies.\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='2\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nWhy a resource kit? \\nTo support best practices that make birth safer, AIM and ACOG encourage hospitals providing all \\nlevels of care to obstetric patients to develop rapid pregnancy response teams; use standardized \\ncommunication tools among teams; regularly implement emergency drills and simulations; and ensure \\nthat emergency supplies are available and accessible.5 This resource kit is a collection of best practices \\nto aid in the development of systems and processes to appropriately triage and care for people \\nexperiencing obstetric emergencies in Emergency Departments (EDs) and hospitals with limited access \\nto specialist care providers.\\nWho should use this resource kit? \\nThe resource kit is best used by healthcare professionals, project managers, quality improvement \\nprofessionals, and hospital leadership charged with preparing to respond to emergencies that may \\ncause or contribute to maternal mortality and SMM. This resource kit may particularly benefit Family \\nMedicine practitioners, Emergency Medicine staff, nursing administrators, and other leaders at small \\nrural hospitals that may rarely encounter an obstetric emergency.  \\nThis resource kit may be implemented by a facility-based or regionalized interdisciplinary team that \\nincludes clinicians, administrators, quality professionals, and ancillary and supporting staff. Individuals \\nmay use the resource kit for professional development and to prepare themselves to be champions for \\nobstetric emergency readiness in their own care settings.\\nResource Kit Scope and Highlights\\n\\u2003\\u2003 This resource kit is not intended to be a response manual but rather provides \\nbackground and resources for review, planning, prioritization, and adaptation to \\nunique needs and clinical settings to support readiness efforts in advance of an \\nobstetric emergency.\\n\\u2003\\u2003 This resource kit may particularly benefit Family Medicine and Emergency Medicine \\nclinicians, nursing administrators, and other leaders in clinical settings that may not \\nroutinely encounter an obstetric emergency.\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Because high quality care is not possible without equitable care, centering equity in \\nquality improvement and implementation of elements of this resource kit is crucial \\nto address inequities that lead to disparities in health outcomes.\\nResource Kit Information'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='3\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nHow was this resource kit prepared?  \\nAIM convened a multidisciplinary subject matter expert working group to identify high level \\nrecommendations for facilities to prepare for obstetric emergencies.

Each section provides information and resources \\nto build systems and structures to deliver evidence-based care. The resource kit also shares examples of \\nprotocols, checklists, and policies to improve standardization of procedures and communication, which \\nmay reduce patient harm. All resource kit components are descriptive rather than prescriptive to allow \\nfor local customization and appropriate clinical judgment in implementation.  \\nThis resource kit is not intended to be a response manual but rather provides background and resources \\nto teams for review, planning, prioritization, and adaptation to their needs and specific clinical settings \\nin advance of an obstetric emergency. \\nEquity  \\nRespectful, equitable, and supportive care concepts are integrated throughout each section of this \\nresource kit as well as explicitly in the Respectful Care Section. Because high quality care is not possible \\nwithout equitable care, centering equity in quality improvement is crucial to address inequities that \\nlead to disparities in health outcomes. Users are encouraged to prioritize health equity, antiracism, and \\npatient lived experience in each step of work undertaken in implementing elements of this resource kit.  \\nPregnancy Screening \\nBecause recognition of pregnancy status is critical to identifying patients most at risk for SMM and \\nmortality, a frequent recommendation throughout the resource kit and other AIM resources is \\nscreening for current or recent pregnancy within 12 months.   \\nVariations in laws and restrictions related to reproductive health in the United States by state and \\njurisdiction may lead to complexity and challenges around this recommendation. While further detailed \\nin the Recognition Section of the resource kit, the intention of screening is to contextualize presenting \\npatient symptoms.\\nThose implementing standardized verbal screening for current or recent pregnancy should note: \\n\\u2003\\u2003 There is no evidence supporting the performance of routine hCG biological pregnancy testing \\nin ED settings outside of clinical indication.  \\n\\u2003\\u2003 Timing, not outcome or resolution of a pregnancy, is the impetus behind this verbal screening \\nrecommendation. Eliciting details on the outcome of a pregnancy is not required to meet this \\nrecommendation.\\n\\u2003\\u2003 As with all potentially sensitive topics, the utmost care should be taken to provide patient privacy \\nand confidentiality in both addressing this topic in triage and care, as well as in documentation \\nof responses.\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Clinicians should remain aware of all state and local laws related to reproductive care and reporting \\nthat may impact the setting in which they care for patients.

Drills may enhance team communication skills, improve response to medical emergencies, and \\nreduce barriers that limit staff communication and patient care.1 Key features of effective drills are that they \\nare coordinated, supervised, focus on testing a specific operation or function, and take place in real time.4 Drills \\nand simulations may be conducted in a variety of settings such as in-situ, a lab environment, or virtually. Each \\nenvironment offers different strengths. For example, drills conducted in-situ may better identify barriers in the \\nphysical environment, while virtual drills may support increased staff participation and completion.\\nResource— Obstetric In-Situ Drill Program Manual\\nSupported by AIM, the OB In-Situ Drill Program Manual is a guide to support best practices in \\nimplementing a simulation program.

As the COVID-19 pandemic underscored, challenges such as disrupted supply \\nchains, staffing shortages, and underdeveloped communications strategies can strain even the \\nbest-prepared facilities. Developing and implementing drills and simulations that address obstetric \\nemergencies in a variety of challenging settings can support the development of a resilient and \\nadaptable workforce. Facilities may even explore the creation of reusable and cost-effective simulation \\nmodels using commonly found items.4\\nA variety of digital platforms and programs exist for virtual simulations. One program is Project \\nExtension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO), a “collaborative model of medical education \\nand care management that helps clinicians provide expert-level care to patients” regardless of \\ngeographic location.6 ECHO clinics across the United States share best practices through case-based \\nlearning, peer-to-peer support, and mentoring opportunities, with potential benefits for improving \\nobstetric care.7\\nPlan for Appropriate Patient Transfer to Higher Levels of Care  \\nTimely patient stabilization and transport is key for effective response to obstetric emergencies, the \\nprovision of risk-appropriate care, and ultimately reducing preventable morbidity and mortality.8  \\nTeams without formal obstetric services should establish appropriate plans and pathways for patient \\nstabilization and transport to higher levels of care.\\nDevelop Care Process Models for Appropriate Care of Pregnant and Postpartum People in Non-\\nObstetric Care Settings\\nTeams can work with internal partners, such as EDs and hospital ancillary services, and external \\npartners, such as emergency medical service (EMS) providers, to establish shared guidelines for the \\ntriage and transport of obstetric patients. 9 Teams can develop a care process model that provides \\nguidelines to quickly and accurately identify obstetric patients who may benefit from transfer to a higher \\nlevel of care. Teams may develop additional tools, such as decision trees or process checklists, \\nto operationalize their developed care process models.10\\nAs teams develop a care process model, they should consider multiple clinical scenarios that may \\nwarrant safe stabilization and transfer, such as whether delivery is imminent and patient medical \\nstability. Once care processes and procedures have been developed and tested, facilities should \\nformalize this information into policy and guidelines.\\nExample—Comprehensive Drills and Simulation Guide\\nThe Perinatal Quality Collaborative of Vermont with support from the Vermont Child Health \\nImprovement Program and the University of Vermont Medical Center compiled a resource guide \\nfor obstetrical drills and simulation.

By connecting \\nwith patients directly via audio or video, providers can conduct virtual assessments of pregnant and \\npostpartum patients. \\nTelemedicine is considered an appropriate strategy to improve clinical care in EDs.12 Examples of telehealth \\napplications in these settings include tele-triage where a remotely-based provider screens patients \\npresenting to the ED; remote clinical consultation where ED physicians consult with peers or specialists \\nthrough any number of communication methods for real-time guidance (see the Remote Clinical \\nConsultation subsection for more details);13 and tele-pharmacy services.14\\nExample— Mayo Clinic Acute Tele-OB Program\\nThe Mayo Clinic runs a 24/7 service “to improve care quality and help medical centers achieve the \\nstandard of care for serious events in pregnant patients, including severe hypertension treatment \\nwithin 30 minutes.” The goal is to offer around-the-clock consultation capability for providers in \\nsmall or rural emergency departments when confronted with an obstetric emergency.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='16\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nRemote Clinical Consultation \\nRemote clinical consultation may expand access to and improve care by connecting providers in lower \\nresourced settings to specialists anywhere in the world for consultation, skills development, peer-to-peer \\nlearning, mentoring, and continuing education. Project ECHO, specifically, has emerged as a cost-effective \\nand impactful strategy for improving participant knowledge and patient access to care.15\\n \\nTeams may implement processes for remote clinical consultation through strategies such as Project ECHO, \\nphysician consultation phone lines, and phone trees. Other clinical consultation examples include tele-\\nradiology in which radiological studies, such as ultrasounds or x-rays, are read remotely for settings in which \\nthat expertise is not present. Teams may also utilize other condition-specific clinical consultation resources, \\nsuch as Perinatal Psychiatry Access Programs, to care for pregnant and postpartum patients.16\\nDevelop and Maintain Referral Resources and Care Coordination Pathways \\nDeveloping and maintaining a robust network of referrals and resources is useful for connecting patients \\nwith material, emotional, and social support after emergencies. Identifying and sharing community \\nresources before, during, and after pregnancy may reduce risk and improve perinatal outcomes.17 Referral \\nto community resources and supports may also reduce postpartum ED usage.18\\nResources should include referrals to local or telehealth specialists such as maternal fetal medicine \\nspecialists, genetic counselors, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and psychiatrists; local community-based \\nservices such as food and diaper banks and home-visiting programs; mental health supports such as social \\nworkers, counselors, and therapists; and substance use disorder treatment options including inpatient and \\noutpatient recovery programs and peer recovery supports. \\nResource lists should also include information on accessing medical insurance coverage, such as information \\ncards for local medical insurance or a general information sheet on available assistance for accessing \\nmedical insurance.19 Teams should develop referral networks and identify community resources that can \\nmeet a variety of patient needs, including different literacy proficiencies, language preferences, and cultural \\nbackgrounds.20 Examples of national resources that may be included in a resource list are in Table 7.\\nTeams should include social work or case management, if available, to identify resources appropriate for \\npregnant and postpartum people and care coordination pathways with obstetric care providers. Teams \\nmay outreach local health departments, local or regional maternal and child health coalitions, and other \\ncommunity-based organizations to identify available resources. \\nResource—Perinatal Psychiatry Access Programs\\nPerinatal Psychiatry Access Programs are state- and organization-based programs that \\nprovide education to healthcare professionals and staff, real-time psychiatric consultation \\nfor professionals caring for people with perinatal mental health conditions, and referrals \\nto community- based mental health resources.

Pregnancy \\nor recent pregnancy status may not be readily apparent to healthcare professionals, and patients may \\nnot recognize the potential relevance of a current or recent pregnancy to their current symptoms. Due \\nto physiologic changes that occur during and following pregnancy, understanding a person’s pregnancy \\nstatus can help contextualize signs and symptoms and help identify potentially life-threatening \\nconditions and the need for escalations in care.1 \\nScreening for this purpose does not include routine blood or urine testing unless otherwise indicated for \\ndiagnosis or treatment. Staff and healthcare professionals should verbally screen for current or recent \\npregnancy in a private area to maintain patient confidentiality and safety. Healthcare professionals \\nshould be mindful of relevant laws and regulations surrounding pregnancy reporting and sharing \\nprotected health information as they verbally screen any patient.2\\nScreening for current or recent pregnancy may include asking,\\n“Are you currently pregnant, or have you been pregnant \\nwithin the last year?”\\nTriage and Evaluate for Urgent Signs and Symptoms in Collaboration with \\nObstetric Care Professionals\\nInitial assessments of acuity for pregnant and postpartum people informs the overall trajectory of \\npatient care.3 Emergency Department (ED) professionals may initially use acuity tools for nonpregnant \\nadults to triage pregnant and postpartum people presenting for care and determine priority for \\nevaluation. Teams may also use developed care process models to guide triage of pregnant and \\npostpartum people in the ED.

For example, mental health conditions, inclusive of accidental overdose, are the leading \\nunderlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.8 Healthcare professionals may \\nconsider screening for substance use disorders using validated verbal screening tools to identify people \\nwho may be at risk and provide resources to support harm reduction and access to desired treatment. \\nAs the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths among non-Hispanic Black people in the United \\nStates is cardiac conditions,8 healthcare professionals may consider universal awareness of comorbid \\nconditions and risk factors for future cardiac disease to address disparities in mortality. These \\ncomorbid conditions and risk factors for future cardiac disease, which are applicable to all pregnant \\nand postpartum people regardless of race or ethnicity, include preeclampsia and other hypertensive \\ndisorders, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, small-for-gestational age newborns, and stillbirth.9 \\nSimilar screening strategies may be used for other leading underlying causes of pregnancy-related \\ndeaths, such as mental health conditions, and suggested screenings and response to positive screens \\nare detailed further in the Response Section of this resource kit.\\nProvide Patient Education on Urgent Signs and Symptoms During Pregnancy \\nand Postpartum and When to Seek Care   \\nReviews of maternal mortality in the United States highlight the need to provide patient education on \\nthe early warning signs of life-threatening complications.10 Education on warning signs is also reported \\nby patients as an important tool to determine the need to seek care, and these educational materials \\ncan be printed and shared with patient support networks.11  \\nEducation on signs and symptoms should indicate whether concerns may be appropriately addressed in \\nan outpatient setting, or if emergency care is needed.

Specific considerations for care may be \\ngeneralizable or condition specific. Response should include activation of planned response teams and \\ninitiation of standard protocols.\\nRoutine Birth in Non-obstetric Settings\\nWhile instances where unplanned or precipitous birth in the Emergency Department (ED) or other \\nnon-obstetric care settings may occur, this resource kit is focused on specific clinical conditions that \\ncontribute to morbidity and mortality and does not address standard delivery care and management. \\nPreparation for birth in the ED may be supported through many concepts in this resource kit. Concepts \\ndiscussed in the Readiness and Reporting and Systems Learning sections of this resource kit, for \\nexample, may be particularly helpful to prepare for birth on non-obstetric settings. Routine trainings, \\nsuch as Basic Life Support in Obstetrics (BLSO) and Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO), drill and \\nsimulation concepts and exercises, and other fundamental safety concepts such as huddles, debriefs, \\nand action planning may contribute to cultures of quality and safety for all obstetric care provided in \\nnon-obstetric settings. \\nPerimortem Cesarean Delivery \\nPerimortem cesarean delivery or hysterotomy is the surgical delivery of a fetus at or near the time \\nof death of the pregnant patient.1 While never a desired outcome, healthcare professionals in non-\\nobstetric settings may be called upon to perform this procedure when providing care to pregnant \\npatients. While it is outside the purview of this resource kit to address procedures that are intended \\nto save the life of the infant in event of a maternal death, there is evidence that the delivery of a fetus \\nfrom a uterus at umbilicus or more than 20 weeks gestation may improve maternal outcomes in cardiac \\narrest where resuscitation has not been successful.2 Resuscitative hysterotomy would optimally occur \\nwithin minutes of maternal cardiac arrest if there is lack of return of spontaneous circulation, although \\na 50% injury-free survival rate was noted in maternal and neonatal survival curves as late as 25 minutes \\nafter onset of arrest.2 \\nWhile no clear, standardized guideline exists for when this procedure should be performed,1 consideration \\nand planning for this rare event should be part of readiness planning in all sites that provide emergency \\ncare. Perimortem cesarean delivery and resuscitative hysterotomy should be included as part of obstetric \\nfocused drills and simulations in emergency care settings and education and training for team members \\nshould be provided. Ideally, surgical delivery instruments and equipment should be on hand, including \\na cord clamp, and training should include that a delivery can be initiated with only a scalpel while \\nadditional resources and equipment are gathered.2\\nReferences\\n1 Krywko DM, Sheraton M, Presley B.

AIM PSBs \\nare evidence-based and, when elements are implemented collectively and reliably, improve quality of \\ncare and patient outcomes.\\nWhile AIM PSBs are commonly implemented in obstetric care settings, PSB elements can be implemented \\nacross the continuum of care and serve as a tool for non-obstetric care settings. By implementing key \\nelements and concepts, teams in non-obstetric care settings may also prioritize resources and equipment \\nneeded to care for pregnant and postpartum patients and implement effective processes to appropriately \\nprepare for and respond to emergencies. \\nThis section summarizes key elements and details from 6 of AIM’s core PSBs that can be implemented in \\nnon-obstetric care settings, such as Emergency Departments (EDs). As elements in AIM’s core PSBs cross \\nmultiple sections of the resource kit, details in the section may mirror content in other sections of the \\nresource kit.\\nClinical Takeaways\\nObstetric Hemorrhage \\n\\u2003\\u2003 Uterine atony is the leading cause of obstetric hemorrhage, and uterotonic agents \\ncan be a first line treatment to manage bleeding.\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Teams should ensure immediate access to a hemorrhage cart with supplies, \\nchecklists, instruction cards for devices or procedures, and to a kit or equivalent \\nwith first and second line hemorrhage medications.\\nBackground\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Obstetric hemorrhage (OBH) is the second leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the \\nUnited States.1\\n\\u2003\\u2003 OBH is the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths among non-Hispanic Asian people in the \\nUnited States.1\\n\\u2003\\u2003 In sentinel events among pregnant and postpartum people, OBH is a causal factor in over half \\nof these events.2 \\n\\u2003\\u2003 Approximately 20% of OBH occur among people with no risk factors.2'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='25\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nDefinition\\nAIM’s Obstetric Hemorrhage patient safety bundle (PSB) uses the ACOG reVITALize definition for \\nearly postpartum hemorrhage, which is defined as cumulative blood loss ≥ 1,000 mL or blood loss \\naccompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours after any birth process, including \\nintrapartum loss, regardless of route of delivery.3 \\nPrimary and secondary hemorrhage may occur and are differentiated based on the timing of the bleeding. \\nThe former occurs within 24 hours of the birth process, and the latter occurs beyond 24 hours after the \\nbirth process.4,5 Healthcare professionals should consider these OBH definitions during triage, as well. \\nCritical Signs and Symptoms\\nObstetric hemorrhage can be identified by determining a patient’s pregnancy and postpartum status. \\nPregnant and postpartum people presenting for care may appear healthy, even while beginning to \\nexperience hypovolemia and sustaining significant blood loss.\\nQuantitative and cumulative techniques should be used to determine patient blood loss whenever possible. \\nEmergency departments can prepare to measure loss cumulatively by preparing scales and documentation \\nof weights of dry pads and other materials to be placed near scales to use to determine blood loss.3 Triggers \\nin the electronic medical record may aid in calculation and ongoing communication of blood loss.3 \\nLess than 500mL of blood loss is considered within the normal range for a vaginal birth.4 Blood loss of \\n500-999 mL alone should trigger increased supervision and potential interventions.6 Awareness of signs \\nand symptoms of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, oliguria, pallor, dizziness, \\nor altered mental status, aids in the identification of excess bleeding, in addition to quantitative, \\ncumulative blood loss measurement.6\\nResponse and Clinical Keys\\nOnce an OBH is identified, the response team should determine hemorrhage etiology. This will help \\nteams determine next steps for care in accordance with their facility’s stage-based OBH emergency \\nmanagement plan.4 Utilization of the “Four T’s” mnemonic device available in Table 1 can assist teams \\nin determining etiology.7 Uterine atony is the leading cause of obstetric hemorrhage,8 and uterotonic \\nagents can be a first line treatment to manage bleeding.7\\nTable 1.

For example, by the \\nsecond trimester there are increases in heart rates and decreases in diastolic blood pressures that are \\nwithin the range of normal for a pregnancy but may be indicative of sepsis in other circumstances.3 \\nAdditionally, leukocyte counts have been noted to increase from 6,000 to 15,000 cells/mm3 during \\nthe second and third trimesters,4 and lactic acid has been noted to be elevated during active labor.5 \\nVital sign thresholds alone are not appropriate for determining sepsis. Healthcare professionals must \\nconsider sepsis as part of a differential diagnosis, particularly among patients with a deteriorating status \\nand even if a patient does not have a fever.6 \\nPregnancy-adjusted sepsis screening tools should be used with patients between 20 weeks gestation \\nand up to 3 days postpartum. For those who are prior to 20 weeks gestation or after 3 days postpartum, \\nhealthcare professionals can use non-obstetric specific screening criteria for sepsis.7  \\nIn settings that may not have access to obstetric or specialist care, healthcare professionals and staff \\nmay consider sepsis screening that is more sensitive for more rapid identification of sepsis and timely \\nconsultation and care.

While this definition does not encompass the range of substances that comprise all \\nSUDs, it should be acknowledged that other substances may contribute to morbidity and mortality.\\nCritical Signs and Symptoms\\nScreening all pregnant and postpartum people for SUDs using a validated self-reported verbal screening \\nmethod is critical for recognizing these and providing referral to appropriate treatment.  Screening should be \\nprovided universally as part of a comprehensive conversation between the patient and provider.  Screening \\nshould not be provided solely based on the presence of risk factors, actual or perceived. Urine toxicology \\n(i.e., urine drug testing) is not an appropriate or recommended method of SUD screening and can discourage \\npregnant and postpartum people from seeking necessary care.2\\nExamples of validated screening tools for pregnancy include the Substance Use Risk Profile, AUDIT-C (alcohol \\nonly), CRAFFT (for those under age 26), AASIS, NIDA Quick Screen, and 4Ps.8 Further examples and resources \\nthat discuss screening tools in more detail are in the Readiness Section of this resource kit.\\nCare for Pregnant and Postpartum People with \\nSubstance Use Disorder '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='44\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nResponse and Clinical Keys \\nWhile all people may experience significant barriers to care for SUDs, pregnant and postpartum people \\nwith SUDs often face greater barriers to entering treatment. Healthcare professionals should consider \\nassisting pregnant and postpartum people with SUDs through brief interventions and referrals to \\nevidence-based, person directed treatment.\\nHealthcare professionals and staff can proactively identify community resources and SUD treatment \\nprograms that are welcoming and accessible to pregnant and postpartum people in anticipation of the \\nneed to facilitate patient referrals, including those available through telehealth. Such treatment programs \\nand referral pathways may include pharmacotherapy, such as MOUD; behavioral health treatment; peer \\nsupport groups; social support services; and harm reduction programs.8 As teams develop resources and \\nreferral pathways as detailed in the Readiness Section of the resource kit, they should include treatment \\npathways for SUDs. \\nOne example of a harm reduction strategy available to Emergency Department (ED) settings is initiating \\nMOUD for patients with opioid use disorder as part of facilitating referrals to more formal treatment.9  \\nWhile not always safe or feasible in a current pregnancy, this initiation may have advantages in rural areas, \\nas it may help remove logistical barriers patients experience accessing this and other treatment.10 \\nInitiation of MOUD during pregnancy should be individualized and in alignment with safe induction \\nprotocols for pregnant and postpartum patients.2 Careful considerations for initiation and dosages can \\nhelp prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms that can cause fetal stress or the patient’s relapse and \\ndiscontinuation of treatment.2 Healthcare professionals should be prepared to undergo additional training \\nin MOUD initiation and to collaborate with their facility’s pharmacy services to appropriately stock MOUD.\\nPregnant women experiencing opioid overdoses who present to EDs have 81% lower odds of receiving \\nnaloxone than non-pregnant women,11 and only 24% of women with a history of perinatal OUD report \\nreceiving a naloxone kit during pregnancy and postpartum.12 Naloxone is a life-saving medication and can \\nbe prescribed and used for pregnant and postpartum people, despite the potential of induced withdrawal \\nand fetal stress.2 Administering naloxone to pregnant and postpartum people in emergency settings and \\ndeveloping naloxone kit distribution programs can directly save lives and prevent fatal opioid overdoses.12\\nED point of care distribution of naloxone to all patients, but particularly those with SUDs, is a feasible harm \\nreduction strategy.13 Teams can develop an opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution protocol that \\nincludes patient screening, order sets, patient training videos, direct dispensing of a naloxone kit, and written \\ndischarge instructions.13 If direct provision of naloxone is not feasible, teams can consider other strategies, like \\ntext message follow ups, to encourage patient acquisition of prescribed life-saving medications.14\\nResource—Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\\nSAMHSA developed an evidence-based resource guide, Use of Medication-Assisted \\nTreatment in Emergency Departments, that provides evidence for initiating MOUD \\nprograms in Emergency Departments, implementation suggestions, and examples \\nof existing Emergency Department programs that initiate MOUD and referrals to \\ncontinuing care.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='45\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nPregnant and postpartum people with SUDs may be screened as appropriate for potential comorbidities, \\nsuch as hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, perinatal mental health \\nconditions, and intimate partner violence.8 Details on screening for perinatal mental health conditions are \\nin the associated Response Section of this resource kit.\\nHealthcare professionals and staff should remain aware of their state statutory and regulatory \\nrequirements regarding substance use during pregnancy and postpartum and work with their facility’s \\nsocial services providers to determine appropriate reporting and to facilitate clear communication with \\nfamilies.8 In balancing state statutory and regulatory requirements, healthcare professionals should be \\naware of racial inequities in reporting to child welfare among people with SUDs.15\\nPeople with SUDs experience stigma and bias at many levels, including within the healthcare system.16 This \\nstigma may be amplified when individuals have additional historically marginalized identities and cause \\npatient hesitancy to seek future care.17 Healthcare professionals and staff can take a trauma-informed \\napproach to caring for patients with SUDs by increasing their awareness of how trauma is associated \\nwith substance use.8 Additionally, de-stigmatizing language should be used when referring to patients17 \\nand dyad-centered care should be encouraged as a way to improve outcomes.8 More detail on trauma-\\ninformed care can be found in the Respectful Care Section of this resource kit.\\nResource—Prescribe to Prevent Naloxone Implementation Resources\\nPrescribe to Prevent developed resources to support Emergency Department teams through \\nimplementation and logistics of naloxone distribution at their institutions.

This section \\nprovides best practices to perform multidisciplinary reviews of serious complications in obstetric patients to \\nsupport quality improvement.\\nCase Identification and Selection\\nFacilities can determine cases for review based on their volume of obstetric patients seen in their ED. In \\nvery low-volume settings, facilities may track all instances of obstetric care and review charts to identify \\nsuccesses and opportunities for improvement.  Such chart reviews could be performed by a quality \\nimprovement committee or during a medical staff meeting, and internal quality and safety leaders \\ncould be engaged during the process. Reviews can consider key elements of care, such as transport \\ntimes, patient outcomes, and any team concerns. All reviews should be seen as a learning opportunity to \\nimprove care.8\\nEach facility should work with facility and system leadership and transfer centers to determine a minimum \\nlist of criteria to consider during chart review. These considerations should be consistent across all \\nobstetric chart reviews and potentially integrated into a facility tool or checklist. A list of possible elements \\nof a chart review for obstetric patients in non-obstetric facilities are in Box 1. This list is not exhaustive or \\nintended to be interpreted as formal guidance, and teams should review and adapt elements in Box 1 in \\nrelation to their quality improvement priorities and needs.\\nTeams may include or collaborate with facilities with obstetric services to inform reviews of obstetric care \\nand can determine in advance the criteria for cases to be collaboratively reviewed. Models for this may range \\nfrom collaboratively reviewing all obstetric cases to reviewing only those with high morbidity or mortality, \\nsuch as cases requiring ≥ 4 units of blood products transfused, any transfers requiring intensive care \\nadmission, all deaths, instances of uterine rupture, or unexpected newborn complications.9 \\nBox 1.

Patients can share their \\nvalues and priorities that influence their medical decision-making and inform the treatment plan. This allows \\npatients to receive personalized information about treatment options, thus supporting their ability to make \\nan autonomous decision in alignment with their own values.4 \\nHealthcare professionals can integrate shared decision making into their practice by utilizing teach-back \\nmethods.1 Teach-back methods help healthcare professionals assess how clearly they communicated \\ninformation to patients and their support networks5 and help establish trust and rapport.6 As healthcare \\nprofessionals utilize the teach-back method and other forms of decision making, they should be mindful to \\nspeak in plain language by avoiding medical jargon1 and pause and check for understanding frequently.6\\nTable 1.

In instances in which medical \\ntreatment is limited to one option, healthcare professionals may need to use compassionate persuasion, \\ninformed consent, or informed refusal to guide care.8 In communicating with patients about limited \\ntreatment options and their values, healthcare professionals should balance positive information sharing \\nwith respect for patient autonomy.8\\nIn other instances, patients may not have the capacity to engage in shared decision making due to \\nphysical deterioration or other factors. In these instances, a patient’s identified support network should \\nbe engaged in care, as appropriate, to align treatment with a patient’s values and wishes before resorting \\nto physician-led decision making.8 Because time to treatment may be of critical importance for life-saving \\ncare, healthcare professionals should engage patient support networks as early as possible to ensure \\ninterventions align with the patient’s values.8\\nExample—Decision Aids\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Massachusetts General Hospital Decision Worksheets\\nLanguage Assistance, Interpretation, and Translation Services\\nPatients requiring language interpretation services have significantly more ED visits and hospitalizations than \\nResources—Decision Aids\\nResources— Shared Decision Making in Emergency Settings\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Washington State Health Care Authority’s How to Identify a High-Quality Patient \\nDecision Aid (PDA)\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI)’s Patient Decision Aids Development Toolkit\\n\\u2003\\u2003 OHRI’s Patient Decision Aids Implementation Toolkit\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s SHARE Approach Curriculum Tools\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Shared Decision-making in the Emergency Department: A Guiding \\nFramework for Clinicians\\n\\u2003\\u2003 Shared Decision-making in the Emergency Department: Respecting Patient \\nAutonomy when Seconds Count'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='patients who do not need such services.9 Patients with limited English proficiency report lower satisfaction \\nfrom medical encounters, differential rates in diagnostic testing, and fewer communications from their \\nhealthcare providers regarding their care.10 As such, easily accessible language assistance services are \\nessential to delivering high-quality care and improving health outcomes.11 \\nLanguage Assistance Services (LAS) via translation or interpretation facilitate effective written and verbal \\ncommunication between healthcare professionals, staff, and patients.3 These services are often part of \\nnational Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Standards,12 accreditation standards,13 and other \\nlegal requirements.14 \\nTeams can determine appropriate LAS based on their patient population and available resources.

This type of care recognizes and acknowledges the role trauma may play in an \\nindividual’s life, including their interactions with medical and healthcare institutions.17 TIC acknowledges \\na patient’s life experiences to deliver effective care and has the potential to improve patient engagement, \\ntreatment adherence, health outcomes, and provider and staff wellness.18 \\nSupport and services should be evidence-based and foster patient engagement, empowerment, and \\ncollaboration.19 This approach involves attention to six key principles rather than prescriptive practices \\nor procedures.20 These principles can be generalized across many settings and can be effective tools \\nin providing TIC:\\n\\u2003\\u20031. Safety\\n\\u2003\\u20032. Trustworthiness and Transparency\\n\\u2003\\u20033. Peer Support\\n\\u2003\\u20034. Collaboration and Mutuality\\n\\u2003\\u20035. Empowerment, Voice, and Choice\\n\\u2003\\u20036. Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues\\nED settings may develop appropriate, actionable strategies to provide TIC for pregnant and postpartum \\npatients. As EDs are critical entry points for care, teams may implement routine and universal screening \\nfor traumatic experiences.21 As a patient screens positive, teams may provide resource listings, educational \\nmaterials, and other supports to facilitate referrals in care.16 More details on developing resource listings and \\nreferral pathways are in the Readiness Section of this resource kit.\\nHealthcare professionals can contribute to a culture of TIC by using psychologically safe practices, such as \\nconfirming a patient’s name, pronunciation, and pronouns; confirming whether patients want others in the \\nexam room, as appropriate; and sitting level with patients while communicating.21\\nAs healthcare professionals begin patient evaluation and exams, they should be mindful of factors that may \\ncontribute to a patient’s feelings of safety, such as respect for patient modesty and privacy.21 Healthcare \\nprofessionals may also guide patients through exams and procedures using person-centered language, \\ndescribing the exam or procedure in detail, giving warning before touching patients, and ensuring they \\nremain in the patient’s line of sight.21\\nHealthcare professionals can use shared decision making as a practical way to integrate TIC into practice as \\nthey determine initial care plans with patients and their support networks.21 More detail on patient-centered \\ncommunication strategies can be found earlier in this section.\\nHealthcare professionals should be regularly trained in principles of TIC. Such education can include \\ninformation on the epidemiology of trauma, its health impacts, trauma responses, and clinical skills for \\nTIC care.22\\nAs healthcare professionals may experience workplace trauma following a severe event, teams may \\nimplement peer support programs to support professionals and develop a just, non-punitive culture \\nfollowing severe events.23'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/Obstetric_Emergency_Resource.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='63\\nObstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit  |  May 2023\\nReferences\\n1 Howell EA, Brown H, Brumley J, Bryant AS, Coughey AB, Cornell AM, et al.

With the \\nimplementation of the Civil Service Reform Program, considerable achievement has been made \\nin transforming customer -based care throughout the health system. The FMOH has undertaken \\ninitiatives for measures to reduce mat ernal mortality through the provision of clean and safe \\ndelivery at the Health Extension Program (HEP) level, skilled delivery and emergency obstetric \\ncare at the facility level, and family planning at all levels of the health care system. \\nTo assure uniform high quality maternal and newborn health service provision in the country, the \\nFederal Ministry of Health recognized the need for a standardized Basic Emergency Obstetric \\nand Newborn Care(BEmONC) training, based on a standard training curriculum and training \\nmaterials, grounded in the objective realities in the country.  This BEmONC Training package \\ncan be used uniformly by all Maternal and Child Health stakeholders involved in training of \\nhealth workers; the training package is meant to serve as a standard guide and resource both for \\npre-service and in-service trainings of health professionals on BEmONC.  \\nThe Federal Ministry of Health would like to extend its compliments to those individuals and \\norganizations that have expended their precious time and resources for the realization of this \\ntraining package.  \\n \\n \\n \\nDr. Tewodros Bekele \\nDirector, Maternal and Child Health Directorate  \\nFederal Ministry of Health - Ethiopia '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Ethiopia BEmONC  Page- iv \\nParticipant’s Handout \\nAcronyms  \\n \\nAMDD  Averting Maternal Death and Disability \\nAMTSL  Active Management of Third Stage of Labor \\nANC   Ante Natal Care \\nAPH   Ante Partum Hemorrhage \\nART   Anti Retroviral Therapy \\nARV   Anti Retro Viral \\nBEmONC   Basic Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care \\nCBT    Competency-based training  \\nCCT   Controlled Cord Traction \\nCEmONC   Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care  \\nCPD   Cephalo Pelvic Disproportion \\nC/S   Cesarean Section \\nEDD    Expected Date of Delivery \\nEDHS   Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey \\nEOC    Emergency Obstetric Care  \\nEONC               Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care \\nFANC               Focused antenatal care  \\nFGC   Female Genital Cutting \\nFHB   Fetal Heart Beat \\nFP   Family Planning \\nGA    Gestational Age \\nGBV   Gender Based Violence \\nHELLP   Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets  \\nHLD   High Level Disinfection \\nHTC    HIV Testing and Counseling  \\nICPD   International Conference on Population and Development \\nIM   Intra Muscular \\nIMPAC   Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth  \\nIMNCI   Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses \\nIP   Infection Prevention '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=\"Ethiopia BEmONC  Page- v \\nParticipant’s Handout \\nITN   Insecticide Treated (bed) Nets \\nIUCD   Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device \\nIUGR   Intra Uterine Growth Restriction \\nIV   Intra Venous \\nKMC   Kangaroo Mother Care  \\nLAM    Lactational Amenorrhoea Method \\nLBW   Low Birth Weight \\nLNMP   Last Normal Monthly Period \\nLRP   Learning Resource Package \\nMDG    Millennium Development Goal  \\nMVA   Manual Vacuum Aspiration \\nPID    Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  \\nPOC    Products Of Conception  \\nPPH   Post Partum Hemorrhage \\nPS   Patient Safety \\nSBA    Skilled Birth Attendant  \\nSTD   Sexually Transmitted Disease \\nSTI    Sexually Transmitted Infection  \\nTOT    Training Of Trainers \\nTT    Tetanus Toxoid  \\nUNFPA  United Nations Population Fund  \\nUNICEF   United Nations Children's Fund \\nVAW   Violence Against Women \\nWHO    World Hea lth Organization \\n \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Ethiopia BEmONC  Page- vi \\nParticipant’s Handout \\nAcknowledgement \\n \\nThe Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia would like to thank Jhpiego Ethiopia, Maternal and \\nChild Health Integrated Program (MCHIP), Integrated Family Health program (IFHP), WHO, \\nIntra Health, Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, UNICEF, Addis Ababa \\nUniversity Medical Faculty, UNFPA, Ethiopian Midwives Association, JSI/L -10 K  and Clinton \\nHealth Access Initiative (CHAI) for major contribution to the development of this Basic \\nEmergency Obstetric and Newb orn Care Training Package.

This \\nparticipant’s handout is a component of the Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care \\n(BEmONC) learning resource package (LRP) prepared for use in Ethiopia in in -service training \\nof doctors, midwives, health officers and/or nurses with midwifery skills who, as team members, \\nwill provide Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) at health centers and \\ndistrict hospitals to avert maternal and newborn mortality & morbidity.  Although the learning \\nresource package is developed primarily for use in district hospital and health centers, it can also \\nbe used by the same mid level health care providers in higher level facilities to provide initial \\ncare and until consultation.  \\n The course follows a modular format and competency -based approach. The content is primarily \\nan adaptation of the LRP, “Emergency Obstetric Care for Doctors and Midwives”, prepared by \\nthe JHPIEGO/MNH Program with support from the Averting Maternal Death and Disability \\nProgram at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University which is consistent \\nwith the WHO materials in the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth \\n(IMPAC) series.  In addition it uses relevant local guidelines and protocols developed by the \\nfederal ministry of health. \\nComponents of the learning resource package are: Training manual, Facilitator’s hand book, \\nParticipant’s handout, power point presentations, technical videos and other relevant \\nresources. There are six modules in the package  and each module describes the learning \\nobjectives, learning outlines, learning materials and assessment tools. Module one is introduction \\nto maternal and newborn health, module two on rapid initial assessment and emergency \\nmanagement; module three on care during pregnancy; module four on care during labor and \\nchild birth; module five on post partum maternal care and module six on newborn care.  Modules \\n4-6 start with basic care and then cover care for life-threatening obstetric emergencies and \\nnewborn problems following a symptom-based approach.  \\nThe training manual contains updated and summarized essential technical information from the \\nrelevant references and is intended to be used as the reference manual by both the facilitators and \\nparticipants. The facilitator’s hand book has two parts; guide for TOT and facilitator’s guide. The \\nguide for TOT part has a 6 days curriculum for training of facilitators and programmers. The \\nfacilitator’s guide part contains the course out lines, learning guides and checklists, exercises, \\nrole plays and answer keys for each module and will guide how to facilitate the training. The \\nparticipant handout is intended primarily to serve for the participant and contains, learning \\nguides and checklists, exercises, role plays and answer keys of each module.  \\nThis training is intended to be completed over three weeks period with 8 days classroom \\ntheoretical sessions & practice on model and 10 days of clinical practice in selected health \\nfacilities. Anatomic models are to be used for training clinical skills in simulated situations and \\nseveral technical videos are included for use with the learning resource package.

The main causes of maternal death and \\ndisability are complications arising from hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, eclampsia and \\nobstructed labor. This training course is, therefore, designed to train doctors, health officers, \\nmidwives and/or nurses with basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care skills who, as team \\nmembers, will provide basic EmONC services in hospitals and health centres to avert maternal \\ndeath and disability. \\n \\nThe course follows a symptom-based approach to the management of life -threatening obstetric \\nemergencies. The main topics in this training course and the reference manuals \\n(MCPC/Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth, PCPNC / Pregnancy, childbirth, \\npostpartum and newborn Care  & MNP /Management of Newborn Problems ) are arranged by \\nsymptom (e.g., vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is how someone with unsafe abortion will \\npresent, convulsions is how a patient with eclampsia presents, shock is how someone with severe \\npostpartum hemorrhage presents). The emphasis in this course is on rapid assessment and \\ndecision-making and clinical action steps based on clinical assessment with limited reliance on \\nlaboratory or other tests, suitable for district hospital and health centers in low resource settings. \\nIn addition, throughout the training course emphasis is placed on recognition of and respect for \\nthe right of women to life, health, privacy and dignity.  \\n \\nCOURSE DESIGN \\nThe course builds on each participant’s past knowledge and takes advantage of her/his high \\nmotivation to accomplish the learning tasks in the minimum time. Training emphasizes doing, \\nnot just knowing, and uses competency-based evaluation of performance.  \\n \\nSpecific characteristics of this course are as follows: \\n• During the morning of the first day, participants demonstrate their knowledge of EmOC \\nby completing a written Precourse Questionnaire. \\n• Classroom and clinical sessions focus on key aspects of EmOC. \\n• Progress in knowledge-based learning is measured during the course using a standardized \\nwritten assessment (Midcourse Questionnaire). \\n• Clinical skills training builds on the participant’s previous experience relevant to EmOC. \\nFor many of the skills, participants practice first with anatomic models, using learning '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Ethiopia BEmONC  Page- x \\nParticipant’s Handout \\nguides that list the key steps in performing the skills/procedures for managing obstetric \\nemergencies. In this way, they learn the standardized skills more quickly. \\n• Progress in learning new skills is documented using the clinical skills learning guides. \\n• A clinical trainer uses competency -based skills checklists to evaluate each participant’s \\nperformance. \\n• Clinical decision -making is learned and evaluated through case studies and simulated \\nexercises and during clinical practice with patients. \\n• Appropriate interpersonal skills are learned through behavior modeling, role play and \\nevaluation during clinical practice with patients.  \\n \\nSuccessful completion of the course is based on mastery of the knowledge and competency in \\nskills components, as well as satisfactory overall performance in providing care for women who \\nexperience obstetric emergencies. Competency  in clinical skills for rare clinical conditions is \\nevaluated in a simulated setting. \\n \\nEVALUATION \\nThis clinical training course is designed to produce healthcare providers (i.e., doctors, health \\nofficers, midwives and/or nurses) who are qualified to provide EmOC, as team members, in \\nhospitals and health centres.  \\n \\nThe evaluation methods used in the course are described briefly below: \\n• Midcourse Questionnaire. Knowledge will be assessed at the 7 th day of the course. A \\nscore of 85% or more correct indicates kn owledge-based mastery of the material \\npresented during classroom sessions. For those participants scoring less than 85% on \\ntheir first attempt, the clinical trainer should review the results with the participant \\nindividually and guide her/him on using the reference manual(s) to learn the required \\ninformation. Participants scoring less than 85% can take the Midcourse Questionnaire \\nagain at any time during the remainder of the course. \\n• Clinical Skills. Evaluation of clinical skills will occur with models in a simulated setting \\nand with patients at the clinical training site. In each setting, the clinical trainer will use \\nskills checklists to evaluate each participant as they perform the skills and procedures \\nneeded to manage obstetric emergencies and interact w ith patients. Case studies and \\nclinical simulations will be used to assess problem- solving and decision -making skills. \\nEvaluation of the interpersonal communication skills of each participant may take place \\nat any point during this period through observation of participants during role plays. \\nParticipants should be competent in performing the steps/tasks for a particular skill or \\nprocedure in a simulated setting before undertaking supervised practice at a clinical site.  \\n• Clinical Practice. It is the clinica l trainer’s responsibility to observe each participant’s \\noverall performance in providing BEmONC during the group -based course and during '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='Ethiopia BEmONC  Page- xi \\nParticipant’s Handout \\nthe self-directed practicum. This includes observing the participant’s attitude —a critical \\ncomponent of quality service provision—toward women who experience obstetric \\nemergencies and toward other members of the BEmONC team. By doing this, the clinical \\ntrainer assesses how the participant uses what s/he has learned.  \\n \\nCOURSE SYLLABUS \\n \\nCourse Description  \\n This clinical training course is designed to prepare participants to manage obstetric emergencies \\nand work effectively as members of a BEmONC team. The course begins with an 18 days block \\nat a designated training site and focuses on the development, application and evaluation of \\nknowledge and skills; the first 8 days take place in the classroom and then 10 days in designated \\nclinical sites, which should be as close to the classroom as possible.  \\n \\nCourse Goals \\n• To influence in a positive way the attitudes of the participant towards team work and \\nher/his abilities to manage and provide basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care \\nservices.  \\n• To provide the participant with the knowledge and clinical skills needed to respond \\nappropriately to obstetric and neonatal emergencies.  \\n• To provide the participant with the decision- making skills needed to respond \\nappropriately to obstetric and neonatal emergencies  \\n• To provide the participant with the interpersonal communication skills needed to \\nrespect the right of women to life, health, privacy and dignity  \\n \\nParticipant

Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in groups of \\nthree to practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s performance; while one participant \\ntakes a history from another, the third participant should use the relevant section of Learning \\nGuide 4.1 to observe performance. Participants should then reverse roles until each has had an \\nopportunity to take a history and be observed. Participants should be able to perform the \\nsteps/tasks relevant to taking a history from the woman in labor before progressing to physical \\nexamination of the woman in labor.  \\n \\nThe facilitator should demonstrate the steps/tasks  in physical examination  of the woman in \\nlabor for participants. Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in pairs \\nand, using the childbirth simulator, practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s \\nperformance; while one participant does the physical examination, the second participant should \\nuse the relevant section of Learning Guide 4.1 to observe performance. Participants should then \\nreverse roles. Participants should be able to perform all of the steps/tasks in Learning Guide 4.1 \\nbefore skills competency is assessed in the simulated setting by the facilitator, using Checklist \\n4.1. \\n \\nFinally, following supervised practice at a clinical site, the facilitator should assess the skills \\ncompetency of each participant using Checklist 4.1. \\n \\nRESOURCES \\n• Childbirth simulator \\n• Sphygmomanometer and stethoscope \\n• Fetal stethoscope \\n• Examination gloves \\n• 0.5% chlorine solution and receptacle for decontamination \\n• Leakproof container or plastic bag \\n \\nThe BEmONC \\nLearning Guide 4.1: Assessment of the Woman in Labor \\nChecklist 4.1: Assessment of the Woman in Labor \\n \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                     MODULE - 4:         CHILDBIRTH  CARE    Page:   67 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nLEARNING GUIDE 4.1: ASSESSMENT OF THE WOMAN IN \\nLABOR \\n \\n(To be completed by Participants) \\nRate the performance of each step or task observed using the following rating scale: \\n1.

The facilitator \\nshould demonstrate the steps/tasks in assisting the birth  (up to but not including active \\nmanagement of third stage). Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work \\nin pairs and, using the childbirth simulator, practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s \\nperformance; while one participant assists the birth, the second participant should use the \\nrelevant section of Learning Guide 4.2 to observe performance. Participants should then reverse \\nroles. Participants should be able to perform the steps/tasks relevant to assisting the birth before \\nprogressing to active management of third stage, examination of placenta, and inspection of \\nvagina and perineum.  \\n \\nThe facilitator should demonstrate the steps/tasks in active management of third stage , as well \\nas the following steps of examination of the placenta and inspection of the vagina and \\nperineum for tears. Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in pairs \\nand, using the childbirth simulator, practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s \\nperformance; while one participant performs active management of third stage, examination of \\nthe placenta, and inspection of the vagina and perineum for tears, the second participant should \\nuse the relevant section of Learning Guide 4.2 to observe performance. Participants should then \\nreverse roles. Participants should be able to perform all of the steps/tasks in Learning Guide 4.2 \\nbefore skills competency is assessed in the simulated setting by the facilitator, using Checklist \\n4.2. \\n \\nFinally, following supervised practice at a clinical site, the facilitator should assess the skills \\ncompetency of each participant, using Checklist 4.2. \\nRESOURCES \\n• Childbirth simulator \\n• High-level disinfected or surgical gloves \\n• Personal protective barriers \\n• Delivery kit/pack \\n• 0.5% chlorine solution and receptacle for decontamination \\n• Leakproof container or plastic bag \\n• The BEmONC \\n• Learning Guide 4.2: Assisting in Normal Birth \\n• Checklist 4.2: Assisting in Normal Birth \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                     MODULE - 4:         CHILDBIRTH  CARE    Page:   80 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nLEARNING GUIDE 4.2: ASSISTING NORMAL CHILDBIRTH \\n(INCLUDING IMMEDIATE NEWBORN CARE AND ACTIVE \\nMANAGEMENT OF THE THIRD STAGE OF LABOR) \\n \\n(To be completed by Participants) \\n \\nRate the performance of each step or task observed using the following rating scale: \\n1.

The two participants taking part in the role play should take a few minutes \\nto prepare for the activity by reading the background information provided below. The remaining \\nparticipants, who will observe the role play, should at the same time read the background \\ninformation. \\n \\nThe purpose of the role play is to provide a n opportunity for participants to \\ndevelop/practice effective interpersonal skills. \\n \\nPARTICIPANT ROLES \\n \\nHealthcare provider:  The healthcare provider is an experienced SBA who has good \\ninterpersonal skills.  \\n \\nWoman in labor:  Merima is16 years old. This is her first pregnancy.  \\n \\nSITUATION \\n \\nMerima has come to the hospital because contractions started 3 hours ago. When the SBA asks \\nMerima how she is feeling she grasps her abdomen with both hands as a contraction begins.

This is her fourth baby.  \\nSITUATION \\n \\nSosina gave birth to a healthy term baby 10 hours ago. The healthcare provider has noticed that \\nthe clothing Sosina has for her baby is not clean. She has also noticed that Sosina has wrapped a \\npiece of unclean cloth tightly around the baby’s abdomen, covering the cord stump.  \\nFOCUS OF THE ROLE PLAY \\n \\nThe focus of the role play is the interpersonal interaction between the healthcare provider and the \\nmother and the appropriateness of the health messages discussed with her.  \\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS \\n \\n1. How did the healthcare provider demonstrate respect and kindness during her interaction \\nwith Sosina?  \\n \\n2. What key health messages related to hygiene and cord care did the healthcare provider \\ndiscuss with Sosina? \\n \\n3. What did the healthcare provider do to ensure that Sosina understood the health messages? \\nEXERCISE 4-1: USING THE PARTOGRAPH \\n \\nPURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this exercise is to enable learners to use the partograph to manage labor. \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                     MODULE - 4:         CHILDBIRTH  CARE    Page:   139 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\n \\nINSTRUCTIONS RESOURCES \\nThe facilitator should review the partograph \\nform with participa nts before beginning the \\nexercise. \\n \\nThe following equipment or representations \\nthereof: \\n\\uf06c Partograph forms (three for each learner) \\n\\uf06c Poster-size laminated partograph \\n\\uf06c Exercise: Using the Partograph Answer \\nKey \\nEach participant should be given three blank \\npartograph forms. \\n  \\nCase 1: The facilitator should read each step to \\nthe class, plot the information on the poster-size \\nlaminated partograph, and ask the questions \\nincluded in each of the steps.

It offers guidance on the way \\npostpartum care could be organized. With respect to clinical problems, attention is focused on \\nprimary care, directed at the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of disease and \\ncomplications, and at referral to hospital if necessary. It introduces the basic components in the \\nprovision of care to the neonate who was born either in the institution or at home in the postnatal \\nperiod. \\n \\nModule objectives \\nBy the end of this module, the participants will be able to: \\n1. Provide basic care to the woman in post-partum period. \\n2. Detect and provide care for diseases and complications in the post-partum period. \\n3. Recognize an emergency situation in the women during the postpartum period which \\nrequires immediate treatment and, in most cases, urgent referral to a higher level health \\nfacility.  \\n4. Provide basic care to the neonate who presented to the health facility in the postnatal \\nperiod. \\n5. Describe steps in rapid initial assessment and emergency management of a sick neonate \\npresenting to the health facility. \\n6. Detect and provide care for sick neonates presenting to the health facility during the \\npostnatal period. \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 183}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                    MODULE- 5:   POSTPARTUM CARE               Page:   156 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nSKILLS PRACTICE SESSION \\nSKILLS PRACTICE SESSION - 5.1:   POSTPARTUM  ASSESSMENT \\n(HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION) AND CARE \\nPURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this activity is to enable participants to practice assessment of the woman during \\nthe postpartum period, including history and physical examination, and achieve competency in \\nthe skills required. \\nINSTRUCTIONS \\nThe first part of this activity (history and physical examination) should be conducted in a \\nsimulated setting using the appropriate model(s). The provision of postpartum care should then \\nbe practiced in a postpartum clinic or postpartum ward. \\n \\nParticipants should review the Learning Guide 5.1 before beginning the activity. The facilitator \\nshould demonstrate the steps/tasks in taking a postpartum history for participants. Under the \\nguidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in groups of three to practice the \\nsteps/tasks and observe each other’s performance; while one participant takes a history from \\nanother, the third participant should use the relevant section of Learning Guide 5.1 to observe \\nperformance. Participants should then reverse roles until each has had an oppor tunity to take a \\nhistory and be observed. Participants should be able to perform the steps/tasks relevant to taking \\na postpartum history before progressing to physical examination.  \\n \\nThe facilitator should demonstrate the steps/tasks in physical examination  of the postpartum \\nwoman for participants. Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in \\npairs and, using the appropriate model(s), practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s \\nperformance; while one participant does the physical examination, the second participant should \\nuse the relevant section of Learning Guide 5.1 to observe performance. Participants should then \\nreverse roles. Participants should be able to perform the steps/tasks for postpartum history and \\nphysical examination before skills competency is assessed in the simulated setting by the \\nfacilitator, using Checklist 5.1. \\n \\nThe provision of postpartum care should be demonstrated in a postpartum clinic or ward and \\nparticipants should then be supervised in the practice of postpartum assessment and care. Finally, \\nfollowing supervised practice at a clinical site, the facilitator should assess the skills competency \\nof each participant using Checklist 5.1. \\n \\nRESOURCES \\n\\uf06c Pelvic model \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 184}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                    MODULE- 5:   POSTPARTUM CARE               Page:   157 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\n\\uf06c Sphygmomanometer and stethoscope \\n\\uf06c Examination gloves \\n\\uf06c 0.5% chlorine solution and receptacle for decontamination \\n\\uf06c Leakproof container or plastic bag \\n\\uf06c Postpartum record \\n\\uf06c Learning Guide 5.1: Postpartum Assessment (History and Physical Examination) and \\nCare \\n\\uf06c Checklist 5.1: Postpartum Assessment (History and Physical Examination) and Care \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 185}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                    MODULE- 5:   POSTPARTUM CARE               Page:   158 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nLEARNING GUIDE 5-1: POSTPARTUM ASSESSMENT (HISTORY AND \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION) AND CARE \\n \\n(To be completed by Participants) \\nRate the performance of each step or task observed using the following rating scale: \\n1.

Participants should then reverse roles until each has had an opportunity to take a \\nhistory and be observed. Participants should be able to perform the steps/tasks relevant to taking \\na newborn history before progressing to physical examination of the newborn.  \\n \\nThe facilitator should demonstrate the steps/tasks in physical examination of the newborn for \\nparticipants. Under the guidance of the facilitator, participants should then work in pairs and, \\nusing the newborn doll, practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s performance; while one \\nparticipant does the physical examination, the second participant should use the relevant section \\nof Learning Guide 5.2 to observe performance. Participants should then reverse roles. \\nParticipants should be able to perform the steps/tasks in taking a newborn history and doing a \\nnewborn physical examination, as outlined Learning Guide 5.2, before skills competency is \\nassessed in the simulated setting by the trainer, using Checklist 5.2. \\n \\nFinally, following supervised practice at a clinical site, the facilitator should assess the skills \\ncompetency of each participant using Checklist 5.2, including breastfeeding and mother -baby \\nbonding. \\n \\nNote: Observation of breastfeeding and mother -baby bonding should be practiced and assessed \\nat the clinical site, under the guidance of the facilitator. \\n \\nRESOURCES \\n\\uf06c Newborn doll  \\n\\uf06c Cloth or baby blanket to wrap doll  \\n\\uf06c Baby weigh scale \\n\\uf06c Thermometer  \\n\\uf06c Newborn record \\n\\uf06c Learning Guide 5.2: Assessment of the Newborn \\n\\uf06c Checklist 5.2: Assessment of the Newborn \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 201}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                    MODULE- 5:   POSTPARTUM CARE               Page:   174 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nLEARNING GUIDE – 5-2: ASSESSMENT OF THE NEWBORN \\n \\n \\n(To be completed by Participants) \\nRate the performance of each step or task observed using the following rating scale: \\n1.

The first step in a skills practice session \\nrequires that participants review the relevant learning guide. Next, the trainer demonstrates the \\nsteps/tasks, several times if necessary, for the particular skill or activity and then has participants \\nwork in groups of two or three to practice the steps/tasks and observe each other’s performance, \\nusing the relevant learning guide. The trainer should be available throughout the session to \\nobserve the performance of participants and provide guidance. Participants should be able to \\nperform all of the steps/tasks in the learning guide before the trainer assesses skill competency \\nusing the relevant checklist. \\n \\nThe learning guides contain the steps or tasks relevant t o the skills for managing maternal or \\nnewborn care or problems and correspond to the information presented in the reference manuals \\nfor the course to ensure standardisation.  \\n \\n\\uf06c Initially, participants can follow  the learning guide as the trainer demonstrates the steps or \\ntasks for a particular procedure. \\n\\uf06c Subsequently, during classroom and clinic practice sessions, they serve as step- by-step \\nguides for the participant as s/he performs the skills. During this phase, participants work in \\ngroups of two or three, using the learning guides to rate each other’s performance or prompt \\neach other as necessary. The clinical trainer(s) will provide guidance to each group to ensure \\nthat learning is progressing and that participants are following the steps outlined.  \\n\\uf06c The checklists are then used by the clinical trainer to evaluate each participant’s performance \\nin providing care.  \\n \\nCriteria for assessment are included at the beginning of the checklists. Assessment of clinical \\nskills will usually take place at the end of the classroom part of the training course. It is \\nimportant that each participant demonstrates the steps or tasks at least once for feedback and \\ncoaching before the final assessment. If a step or task is not performed correctly, the participant \\nshould repeat the entire skill or activity sequence, not just the incorrect step. In addition, it is \\nrecommended that the trainer not stop the participant at the incorrect step unless the safety of the \\nclient is at stake. If it is not, the trainer should allow the participant to complete the \\nskill/procedure before providing coaching and feedback on her/his overall performance. \\nAll of the skills below are included in the training and the following record will be used to track \\nprogress towards skill competency.  \\nBASIC EMONC COURSE \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML/BasicNewbornObstetricCare.pdf', 'page': 219}, page_content=\"         \\n \\nEthiopia BEmONC                     ANNEX               Page:   192 \\nBEmONC -Participant's Handout - Dec 2013 \\nRECORD OF SKILLS             Name: \\n________________________________________________ \\nChecklist  \\nSkill \\nCase Number \\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \\n Antenatal care           \\n Birth planning           \\n Management of severe pre-\\neclampsia/eclampsia \\n          \\n Assessment of the woman in \\nlabor \\n          \\n Assist normal birth, \\nincluding active \\nmanagement of third stage \\nand immediate essential \\nnewborn care  \\n          \\n Vacuum extraction           \\n Breech delivery           \\n Perineal/episiotomy repair           \\n Newborn resuscitation           \\n Assessment of the mother \\nand baby in the first 24 \\nhours after birth \\n          \\n Postabortion care (MVA)           \\n            \\n Manual removal of placenta           \\n Bimanual compression of \\nuterus \\n          \\n Adult resuscitation and \\nmanagement of shock \\n          \\n Use of partograph           \\nNote: The trainer or clinical preceptor will initial case number and note level of competency:  \\nM = performed competently with models;  \\nS = performed with client/patient under supervision of trainer or clinical preceptor;  \\nC = performed competently with client/patient. \\n \")]\n"

Her contractions are regular, occurring once every 10 minutes, each lasting for 20 seconds. Her vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, are within normal ranges. Her fetal heart rate is also within the normal range, at 140 beats per minute with no decelerations noted. Her cervix is mostly effaced, and she still has her membranes intact. At 4 cm dilatation, Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor, and it is not uncommon for this phase to last for several hours. Further evaluation and close monitoring should be conducted to assess her progress and determine any necessary interventions. It's important to continue monitoring her contractions, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate to ensure a safe, healthy delivery for both Mrs. A and her baby. Any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate should be addressed immediately.\n",

            "As Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor at 4 cm cervical dilation, close monitoring and evaluation of her labor pattern, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate are required. Regular contractions and a steady FHR of 140 beats per minute with no decelerations are noted, and her cervix is mostly effaced. However, as labor can last for several hours, it is recommended to initiate fetal heart rate monitoring every 15-30 minutes and to document any variations in the pattern. If any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate are noticed, prompt intervention, such as administering oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, or uterine stimulants, should be implemented. Additionally, continuous fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring may be necessary to ensure safe delivery of the baby. It is also important to monitor Mrs. A's hydration status, pain management, and any potential complications, such as fetal distress, maternal exhaustion, or cervical stasis. These interventions and monitoring should be initiated as deemed necessary by the healthcare provider based on Mrs. A's individual clinical circumstances.\n",

Her contractions are regular, occurring once every 10 minutes, each lasting for 20 seconds. Her vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, are within normal ranges. Her fetal heart rate is also within the normal range, at 140 beats per minute with no decelerations noted. Her cervix is mostly effaced, and she still has her membranes intact. At 4 cm dilatation, Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor, and it is not uncommon for this phase to last for several hours.

            "Based on the given medical document, it is evident that Mrs. A is in active labor at 39 weeks gestation. Her contractions are regular, occurring once every 10 minutes, each lasting for 20 seconds. Her vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, are within normal ranges. Her fetal heart rate is also within the normal range, at 140 beats per minute with no decelerations noted. Her cervix is mostly effaced, and she still has her membranes intact. At 4 cm dilatation, Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor, and it is not uncommon for this phase to last for several hours. Further evaluation and close monitoring should be conducted to assess her progress and determine any necessary interventions. It's important to continue monitoring her contractions, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate to ensure a safe, healthy delivery for both Mrs. A and her baby. Any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate should be addressed immediately.\n",
