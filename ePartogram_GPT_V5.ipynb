The majority of these deaths \\noccur in low-resource settings and are largely preventable through timely interventions (3). \\nMonitoring of labour and childbirth, and early identification and treatment of complications \\nare critical for preventing adverse birth outcomes. Improving the quality of care around the \\ntime of birth has been identified as the most impactful strategy for reducing stillbirths and \\nmaternal and newborn deaths, compared with antenatal or postnatal care strategies (4).\\nIn February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a consolidated set \\nof recommendations on intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). The \\nrecommendations include new definitions of the duration of the first and second stages of \\nlabour and provide guidance on the timing and use of labour interventions to improve the \\nhealth and well-being of women and their babies (5–7). The recommendations are based on \\nthe principle that, through the use of effective labour and childbirth practices and avoidance \\nof ineffective (and potentially harmful) practices, health personnel can support women to \\nachieve their desired physical, emotional and psychological outcomes for themselves, their \\nbabies and their families (8). \\nWHO recommendations on intrapartum care specify evidence-based practices that should \\nbe implemented throughout labour and the immediate postnatal periods, and discourage \\nineffective practices that should be avoided. WHO recommendations cover:\\n\\x1d\\x1d care throughout labour and birth: respectful maternity care, effective communication, \\nlabour companionship, and continuity of care;\\n\\x1d\\x1d first stage of labour: definition of the latent and active first stages, duration and \\nprogression of the first stage, labour ward admission policy, clinical pelvimetry on \\nadmission, routine assessment of fetal well-being on labour admission, pubic shaving, \\nenema on admission, digital vaginal examination, vaginal cleansing, continuous \\ncardiotocography, intermittent fetal heart rate (FHR) auscultation, pain relief, oral \\nfluid and food, maternal mobility and position, active management of labour, routine \\namniotomy, oxytocin for preventing delay, antispasmodic agents, and intravenous fluids \\nfor preventing labour delay;\\n\\x1d\\x1d second stage of labour: definition and duration of the second stage of labour, birth \\nposition (with and without epidural analgesia), methods of pushing, techniques for \\npreventing perineal trauma, episiotomy, and fundal pressure;\\n\\x1d\\x1d third stage of labour: prophylactic uterotonics, delayed umbilical cord clamping, \\ncontrolled cord traction, and uterine massage;\\n\\x1d\\x1d care of the newborn: routine nasal or oral suction during resuscitation, skin-to-skin \\ncontact, breastfeeding, haemorrhagic disease prophylaxis using vitamin K, and bathing \\nand other immediate postnatal care of the newborn;\\n\\x1d\\x1d care of the woman after birth: uterine tonus assessment, use of antibiotics, routine \\npostpartum maternal assessment, and discharge following uncomplicated vaginal birth.\\nTo facilitate effective implementation of the above recommendations, WHO reviewed and \\nrevised the design of the previous partograph. The LCG was designed for health personnel \\nto monitor the well-being of women and babies during labour through regular assessments \\nto identify any deviation from normality. The tool aims to stimulate shared decision-making \\nby health-care providers and women, and to promote women-centred care. The LCG is \\nintended as a resource to ensure quality evidence-based care, with a special emphasis on \\nensuring safety, avoiding unnecessary interventions, and providing supportive care.'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 9}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n2\\nObjective of this manual\\nThis manual has been developed to help health personnel who care for women during labour \\nand childbirth to successfully use the LCG.\\nTarget audience\\nThe primary target audience for this manual is skilled health personnel directly providing \\nlabour and childbirth care in all settings. This includes midwives, nurses, general medical \\npractitioners and obstetricians. The manual will also be of interest to staff involved in \\ntraining health care personnel, health-care facility managers, implementers and managers \\nof maternal and child health programmes, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and \\nprofessional societies involved in the planning and management of maternal and child health \\nservices.\\nThe Labour Care Guide\\nThe principal aims of the LCG are to:\\n\\x1d\\x1d guide the monitoring and documentation of the well-being of women and babies and the \\nprogress of labour\\n\\x1d\\x1d guide skilled health personnel to offer supportive care throughout labour to ensure a \\npositive childbirth experience for women\\n\\x1d\\x1d assist skilled health personnel to promptly identify and address emerging labour \\ncomplications, by providing reference thresholds for labour observations that are intended \\nto trigger reflection and specific action(s) if an abnormal observation is identified\\n\\x1d\\x1d prevent unnecessary use of interventions in labour\\n\\x1d\\x1d support audit and quality improvement of labour management.\\nFor whom should the LCG be used?\\nThe LCG has been designed for the care of women and their babies during labour and \\nchildbirth. It includes assessments and observations that are essential for the care of all \\npregnant women, regardless of their risk status. However, the LCG was primarily designed \\nto be used for the care of apparently healthy pregnant women and their babies (i.e. women \\nwith low-risk pregnancies). Women at high risk of developing labour complications may \\nrequire additional specialized monitoring and care (9).\\nUpon arrival in the labour unit, women should have an initial assessment to determine \\nwhether labour has started. Detailed guidance on how to perform an initial evaluation to \\nassess the well-being of the woman and her baby and determine the stage of labour can be \\nfound in Pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care: a guide for essential practice (10). \\nWomen in labour will require further monitoring of the progress of labour with the LCG. \\nWhen should the LCG be initiated?\\nDocumentation on the LCG of the well-being of the woman and her baby as well as \\nprogression of labour should be initiated when the woman enters active phase of the first \\nstage of labour (5\\xa0cm or more cervical dilatation), regardless of her parity and membranes \\nstatus. \\nAlthough the LCG should not be initiated in the latent phase of labour, it is expected that \\nwomen and their babies are monitored and receive labour care and support during the latent \\nstage. Detailed guidance on care for women in the latent phase of labour can be found in \\nPregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care: a guide for essential practice (10).'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 10}, page_content='3\\nWhere should the LCG be used?\\nThe LCG is designed to be used for all births in health facilities, including primary, secondary \\nand tertiary care settings. Women giving birth in lower-level facilities may require referral to \\na higher level of care if complications ensue. Women in such settings should therefore have \\naccess to appropriate referral and transportation options for safe and timely transfer. The \\nuse of the LCG can facilitate early identification of potential complications; hence, it should \\ncontribute to timely referrals when required. \\nStructure of the LCG\\nThe LCG has seven sections, which were adapted from the previous partograph design. The \\nsections are as follows (see Fig. 1):\\n1. Identifying information and labour characteristics at admission\\n2. Supportive care\\n3. Care of the baby\\n4. Care of the woman\\n5. Labour progress\\n6. Medication\\n7. Shared decision-making\\nSection 1 is for documenting the woman’s name and labour admission characteristics that \\nare important for labour management: parity, mode of labour onset, date of active labour \\ndiagnosis, date and time of rupture of membranes, and risk factors. This section should be \\ncompleted with the information obtained when active labour diagnosis is confirmed.\\nSections 2–7 contain a list of labour observations. The health-care provider should record \\nobservations for all sections soon after the woman is admitted to the labour ward. The \\nremainder of the LCG is then completed following subsequent assessments throughout \\nlabour. For all observations, there is a horizontal time axis for documentation of the \\ncorresponding time of observation and a vertical reference values axis for determination of \\nany deviation from normal observations. The LCG also provides a second-stage section to \\ncontinue the observations made during the first stage of labour (except for cervical dilatation \\nassessment, which ends at the first stage of labour).\\nTHE LABOUR CARE GUIDE\\nSummary of key points on starting to use the LCG\\nFor whom should the LCG be used?\\nAll women in labour.

The decision to intervene in the course of labour is primarily \\nbased on observation of a deviation from expected observations during these assessments. \\nTo facilitate action-oriented labour monitoring, the LCG provides explicit reference values \\nfor labour observations and includes a section to document shared decisions to address \\nany deviation from the expected norm. To ensure the systematic and consistent application \\nof the LCG, health providers are encouraged to use the Assess\\xa0Ò\\xa0Record\\xa0Ò\\xa0Check\\xa0Ò\\xa0Plan \\napproach, which involves: \\n\\x1d\\x1d Assess (assess the well-being of woman and her baby, and progress of labour)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Record (document labour observations)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Check reference threshold  (compare labour observations with reference values in the \\n“Alert” column)\\n\\x1d\\x1d Plan (decide whether and what interventions are required, in consultation with the \\nwoman, and document accordingly).\\nIt is important for health-care providers to prospectively monitor the well-\\nbeing of women and babies and the progression of labour, and to apply the \\nAssess\\xa0Ò\\xa0Record\\xa0Ò\\xa0Check\\xa0Ò\\xa0Plan process at each assessment throughout labour. \\nThe sections below provide explanations on how to complete the LCG. A clinical example \\nfollows each section to illustrate the use of the LCG. \\nThe LCG is intended as a guide and is not a substitute for good clinical judgment with \\nrespect to the individual women’s circumstances and preferences. \\nFurther guidance on the clinical management of women during labour and childbirth, \\nincluding management of complications, can be found in Pregnancy, Childbirth, Postpartum \\nand Newborn Care: A guide for essential practice (10) and Managing complications in pregnancy \\nand childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors (9). \\nFor practical reasons this manual describes women’s and babies’ observations separately. \\nHowever, decisions should not be based on findings from individual observations, but rather \\non an overall assessment of the woman and her baby. \\nUsing the LCG\\nTime axis: The first row of the time axis (“Time”) is to register the actual time for each \\nobservation, while the second row (“Hours”) identifies the number of hours that have \\nelapsed during the course of labour (see Fig. 2). The “Time” row is divided into columns for \\nrecording the actual time in hours and minutes. Each column represents 1 clock hour. \\nAs described in the example below, if the first assessment is conducted at 06:30 and the \\nsecond and third assessments are conducted 1 and 2\\xa0hours later, at 07:30 and 08:30, these \\nshould all be recorded in the respective columns. If at 12:30 the woman reaches full cervical \\ndilatation, recording of time in the cells under the second stage should continue. \\nIf labour extends beyond 12 hours, a second LCG form should be commenced. Time should \\nbe recorded using the 12- or 24-hour format, depending on local practice.\\nThe reference (“Alert”) column:  The “Alert” column presents thresholds for abnormal \\nlabour observations that require further assessment and action by the health-care provider, \\nas summarized in Tables 3–7. If labour observations do not meet any of the criteria in the \\n“Alert” column, labour progression and care should be regarded as normal, and no medical \\nintervention is warranted.\\nHOW TO USE THE LABOUR CARE GUIDE'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 13}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n6\\nHealth-care providers should circle any observations meeting the criteria in the “Alert” \\ncolumn. This should help to highlight those observations that require special attention. \\nWhile the reference thresholds are largely based on WHO guidance, a few were derived \\nfrom expert consensus. It is important to note that the reference thresholds are meant to be \\nused as early-warning signals. Therefore, reference values should be adapted in accordance \\nwith local guidelines and should not replace the expert clinical judgement of a care provider.\\nFrequency of assessment:  The frequency of observations is similar to that in the previous \\npartograph design, as presented in Tables 4–7. While the frequency of assessment in the \\nLCG is largely based on WHO guidance, for some variables the frequency of monitoring \\nis based on expert consensus rather than high quality evidence. It is important that \\nhealth personnel adapt the monitoring frequencies to each particular clinical case and in \\naccordance with local guidelines. It is expected that the required frequency of assessment \\nwill depend on the results of labour observations and the status of the woman and her baby.\\nNomenclature to complete the LCG \\nWhere a measurement is numerical, actual numbers should be recorded. When \\ndocumenting non-numerical observations – i.e. observations not based on counting – a list of \\nabbreviations is presented to standardize the nomenclature used by health-care teams and \\nto allow consistent interpretation of the “Alert” column (see Table 1).\\nTable 1.

This includes labour companionship, access to pharmacological and \\nnon-pharmacological pain relief, ensuring women are offered oral fluid, and techniques to \\nimprove women’s comfort (such as encouraging women to be mobile during labour) (see \\nTable 3). Supportive care measures should be offered and evaluated continuously during \\nlabour. However, to streamline documentation, observations regarding the provision of \\nsupportive care should be recorded every hour.

ADAPTING THE WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE\\nANNEX 2\\nAdapting the WHO Labour Care Guide \\nThe WHO Labour Care Guide has been developed to align with WHO recommendations on \\nintrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). Some adaptations may be needed to \\nreflect local conventions (e.g. the use of Hodge planes for classifying fetal descent).\\nRemoving recommended practices from the LCG is strongly discouraged. Even in those \\nsettings where some interventions are less feasible or not consistently available, monitoring \\nthe use of these interventions is important to help drive improvements in overall quality of \\ncare.\\nBelow we describe a process for reviewing the LCG and identifying elements to be adapted \\n(see Fig. 9).\\nFig. 9. Process for adapting the LCG\\nAim for quality  \\nof care\\nAny adaptations of the LCG should be undertaken with \\ncaution to ensure that effective interventions are not \\nremoved. \\nNational or local experts should review the LCG in light \\nof relevant national standards and guidelines. Health-\\ncare providers working in maternity-care settings should \\nbe involved in adaptation activities.\\nPrior to any rollout of an adapted LCG, pilot it in clinical \\nsettings and encourage end-users’ feedback. This can \\nfacilitate successful adoption.\\nKeep the LCG focused on labour monitoring and avoid \\nincorporating too many new variables. The LCG should \\nnot replace a medical record. The more items are added, \\nthe more likely clinicians are to record variables twice. \\nWhen incorporating new variables or parameters, \\nconsider: \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it relevant for labour monitoring? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it evidence based? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it feasible to collect it in any different setting? \\n\\x1d\\x1d Is it already in the medical record?\\n\\x1d\\x1d Would it be more appropriate in the medical record?\\nInvolve experts  \\nand end-users\\nPilot the adapted  \\nLCG\\nKeep it concise'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 33}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n26\\nANNEX 3\\nIntroducing the WHO Labour Care Guide  \\ninto labour wards\\nThe LCG is a tool that aims to support implementation of the WHO recommendations: \\nintrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (5). The current level of implementation of \\ndifferent care practices in the LCG may vary. For example, the LCG includes practices that \\nmay already be well implemented in labour wards (e.g. offering pharmacological pain relief). \\nOther practices may not be well implemented, and the LCG can help managers and health-\\ncare providers to set goals to improve the quality of labour and childbirth care. \\nIt is well known that simply disseminating recommendations will not ensure their \\nsuccessful adoption by health-care providers (15). There may also be additional barriers \\nto implementing the LCG into routine care. For example, providers in facilities with high \\nworkloads or fewer resources may consider the LCG time consuming or less feasible. In \\nother facilities, providers may be unwilling to update their long-standing practice or may \\nbe otherwise resistant to adopting the LCG in routine care. In such situations, a robust \\nimplementation strategy should be designed to introduce the LCG into labour wards. \\nTo introduce the LCG in labour care wards, an active multi-component implementation \\nstrategy will be required. A pilot study in six countries identified a number of strategies for \\nimplementing the LCG (16) (see Table 9).\\nTable 9. Strategies for implementing the LCG\\nReview and adaptation Leadership and training\\n✔ Critically review the LCG and decide whether local \\nadaptation is needed.\\n✔ Ensure the abbreviations that providers are \\nrequired to use in the LCG are locally meaningful.\\n✔ Involve local leaders and administrators in \\nadaptation activities.\\n✔ Optimize providers’ time: minimize any duplication \\nof recording between the LCG and medical record.\\n✔ Avoid adding variables, mainly if they are not \\nmeaningful for labour and childbirth care.\\n✔ Target best quality; do not remove LCG \\ncomponents just because they cannot be \\naccomplished.\\n✔ Review policies and associated procedures \\nrequired to provide an enabling environment for \\nuse of the LCG.\\n✔ Translate the LCG, manual and other educational \\nmaterials if necessary.\\n✔ Build a team with expertise in LCG, from various \\ndisciplines (obstetrics, midwifery, nursing), to \\nprovide training. \\n✔ Ask thought leaders and local champions to \\nfamiliarize themselves with the LCG.\\n✔ Plan initial training, refresher trainings and \\ncontinuous support and mentoring activities.\\n✔ Include a strong practical component in the \\ntraining programme.\\n✔ Give time for skills acquisition. Providers may find \\nthe LCG initially offputting, and will need some \\ntime to familiarize with the LCG.\\n✔ Conduct training in the local language. \\n✔ Provide early and structured feedback on \\ncompleted LCGs to help users improve their skills. \\nTeamwork in completing the LCG Monitoring and evaluation\\n✔ The use of the LCG should be the responsibility of \\nthe entire health-care team.\\n✔ The LCG guides objective data-driven decision-\\nmaking. Take into account that some staff \\ncompleting the LCG may require extra support and \\nsupervision.\\n✔ Target universal implementation (in all shifts). The \\nLCG can work well to support handover between \\nshifts.\\n✔ Maintain or establish a monitoring system based \\non the LCG to track quality-of-care indicators, for \\nexample the proportion of women with a labour \\ncompanion of choice, and the caesarean section \\nrate.\\n✔ Show and share quality-of-care indicators to help \\ndrive improvements.

Respectful maternity care – which refers to care \\norganized for and provided to all women in a manner \\nthat maintains their dignity, privacy and confidentiality, \\nensures freedom from harm and mistreatment, and \\nenables informed choice and continuous support during \\nlabour and childbirth – is recommended.\\nRecommended\\nEffective \\ncommunication\\n2. Effective communication between maternity care \\nproviders and women in labour, using simple and \\nculturally acceptable methods is recommended.\\nRecommended\\nCompanionship 3. A companion of choice is recommended for all women \\nthroughout labour and childbirth.\\nRecommended\\nContinuity of care 4. Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known \\nmidwife or small group of midwives supports a woman \\nthroughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal \\ncontinuum, are recommended in settings with well-\\nfunctioning midwifery programmes.\\nContext-specific \\nrecommendation\\nFirst stage of labour\\nDefinitions of the \\nlatent and active first \\nstages of labour\\n5. The use of the following definitions of the latent and \\nactive first stages of labour is recommended for practice:\\n \" The latent, first stage is a period of time characterized \\nby painful uterine contractions and variable changes of \\nthe cervix, including some degree of effacement and \\nslower progression of dilatation up to 5\\xa0cm for first and \\nsubsequent labours.\\n \" The active first stage is a period of time characterized \\nby regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial \\ndegree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical \\ndilatation from 5\\xa0cm until full dilatation for first and \\nsubsequent labours.\\nRecommended\\nDuration of the first \\nstage of labour\\n6. Women should be informed that a standard duration of \\nthe latent first stage has not yet been established and can \\nvary widely from one woman to another. However, the \\nduration of active first stage (from 5\\xa0cm until full cervical \\ndilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12\\xa0hours in \\nfirst labours, and usually does not extend beyond 10\\xa0hours \\nin subsequent labours.\\nRecommended'), Document(metadata={'source': \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of WHO LCG User's Manual.pdf\", 'page': 35}, page_content='WHO LABOUR CARE GUIDE: USER’S MANUAL\\n28\\nCare option  Recommendation Category of \\nrecommendation\\nFirst stage of labour\\nProgress of the first \\nstage of labour\\n7. For pregnant women with spontaneous labour onset, \\nthe cervical dilatation rate threshold of 1\\xa0cm/hour during \\nactive first stage (as depicted by the partograph alert \\nline) is inaccurate to identify women at risk of adverse \\nbirth outcomes and is therefore not recommended for \\nthis purpose.\\n8. A minimum cervical dilatation rate of 1\\xa0cm/hour \\nthroughout active first stage is unrealistically fast for \\nsome women and is therefore not recommended for \\nidentification of normal labour progression. A slower than \\n1\\xa0cm/hour cervical dilatation rate alone should not be a \\nroutine indication for obstetric intervention.\\n9. Labour may not naturally accelerate until a cervical \\ndilatation threshold of 5\\xa0cm is reached. Therefore, the use \\nof medical interventions to accelerate labour and birth \\n(such as oxytocin augmentation or caesarean section) \\nbefore this threshold is not recommended, provided that \\nfetal and maternal conditions are reassuring.\\nNot recommended\\nNot recommended\\nNot recommended\\nLabour ward \\nadmission policy\\n10.

The new edition brings the guidance in the manual into line \\nwith WHO’s current recommendations for emergency obstetric and \\nnewborn care. \\nThe updating process for the second edition involved WHO’s Departments \\nof Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Reproductive \\nHealth and Research as well as MCSP, USAID’s flagship maternal, \\nnewborn and child health program, led by Jhpiego. A core review group \\n(see Acknowledgements) conducted a user survey to solicit feedback on \\nuse of the manual and suggestions to guide the revision. The core group \\nthen updated the following chapters with the current WHO \\nrecommendations: \\n• Section 1: Clinical Principles: Emotional and psychological support, \\nEmergencies, General care principles, Antibiotic therapy, Operative care \\nprinciples, Normal labour and childbirth, and Newborn care principles \\n• Section 2: Symptoms: Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy; Vaginal \\nbleeding after childbirth; Elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred \\nvision, convulsions or loss of consciousness; Fever during pregnancy \\nand labour; Fever after childbirth; Difficulty in breathing; Prelabour \\nrupture of membranes; and Immediate newborn conditions or problems \\n• Section 3: Procedures: Induction and augmentation of labour, \\nManual removal of placenta, and Repair of vaginal and perineal tears \\nThe updated chapters were reviewed at the first core group meeting in \\nWashington, DC, in August 2015. The revised chapters were sent to an \\nexternal panel of expert reviewers (see Acknowledgements). The external \\nexperts were selected on the basis of their clinical experience in emergency \\nobstetric care in low- and middle-income countries. None of the external \\nreviewers reported any conflict of interest.  \\nThe core group met again in Geneva in January 2016 to review comments \\nfrom the external reviewers and to finalize the chapters. The finalized \\nchapters were then sent to the WHO’s Guidelines Review Committee for \\napproval. \\nMinor revisions, including clarification of wording and corrections  \\n(e.g. grammatical and typographical), have been made throughout the \\nmanual.

However, readers are referred to two recent WHO sources on \\nobstetric ultrasound: Chapter 2 in the Manual of Diagnostic Ultrasound, \\nSecond Edition (WHO, 2013) and WHO Recommendations on Antenatal \\nCare for a Positive Pregnancy Experience (WHO, 2016). The latter \\nrecommends one routine ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation.  \\n \\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION \\nIn support of the Safe Motherhood Initiative, the WHO Making Pregnancy \\nSafer Strategy focuses on the Health Sector’s contribution to reducing \\nmaternal and newborn deaths. \\nThe Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC) is the \\ntechnical component of the aforementioned strategy and mainly addresses \\nthe following: \\n• Improving the skills of health workers through locally adapted \\nguidelines and standards for the management of pregnancy and \\nchildbirth at different levels of the health care system; \\n• Interventions to improve the health care system’s response to the \\nneeds of pregnant women and their newborns, and to improve the \\ndistrict level management of health services, including the provision of \\nadequate staffing, logistics, supplies and equipment; \\n• Health education and promotion of activities that improve family and \\ncommunity attitudes and practices in relation to pregnancy and \\nchildbirth. \\nThis manual, and a similar one on the management of preterm and sick \\nnewborns, is written for midwives and doctors working in district \\nhospitals. This manual complements and is consistent with the Essential \\nCare Practice Guide for Pregnancy and Childbirth which is prepared \\nmainly for the primary health care level. Together these manuals will \\nprovide guidance for health workers who are responsible for the care of \\npregnant women and newborns at all levels of care. \\nThe interventions described in these manuals are based on the latest \\navailable scientific evidence. Given that evidence-based medicine is the \\nstandard on which to base clinical practice, it is planned to update the \\nmanual as new information is acquired. \\nIt is hoped that this manual will be used at the side of the patient, and be \\nreadily available whenever a midwife or doctor is confronted with an \\nobstetric emergency.

Around 15% of all pregnant women will develop a potentially  \\nlife-threatening complication that calls for skilled care, and some will \\nrequire a major obstetrical intervention to survive. This manual is written \\nfor midwives and doctors at the district hospital who are responsible for the \\ncare of women with complications of pregnancy, childbirth or the \\nimmediate postpartum period, including immediate problems of the \\nnewborn. \\nIn addition to providing care to women in facilities, midwives and doctors \\nhave a unique role and relationship with: \\n• the community of health care providers within the district \\nhealth system, including auxiliary and multipurpose health \\nworkers; \\n• family members of patients; \\n• community leaders; \\n• populations with special needs (e.g. adolescents, women with \\nHIV/AIDS). \\nMidwives and doctors: \\n• support activities for the improvement of all district health \\nservices; \\n• strive for efficient and reliable referral systems; \\n• monitor the quality of health care services; \\n• advocate for community participation in health-related \\nmatters. \\nA district hospital is defined as a facility that is capable of providing \\nquality services, including caesarean birth and blood transfusion. Although \\nmany of the procedures in this manual require specialized equipment and \\nthe expertise of specially trained providers, it should be noted that many of \\nthe life-saving procedures described can also be performed at health \\ncentres. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='xii Introduction \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=\"HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL xiii \\nA woman presenting with a life-threatening obstetric complication is in an \\nemergency situation requiring immediate diagnosis and management. \\nTherefore, the main text of this manual is arranged by symptom  \\n(e.g. vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy). Because this symptom-based \\napproach is different than most medical texts, which are arranged by \\ndisease, an indexed list of diagnoses is provided. \\nThe emphasis of the manual is on rapid assessment and decision making. \\nThe clinical action steps are based on clinical assessment, with limited \\nreliance on laboratory or other tests that would be unavailable in many \\nfield situations, and most are possible in a variety of clinical settings  \\n(e.g. district hospital or health centre). \\nSection 1 outlines the clinical principles of managing complications in \\npregnancy and childbirth. It begins with a table that the health care worker \\ncan use to rapidly assess the woman's condition and initiate appropriate \\ntreatment. This section includes the general principles of emergency, \\ngeneral and operative care, including infection prevention, the use of blood \\nand replacement fluids, antibiotics and anaesthesia and analgesia. In order \\nto provide health care workers with the information needed to differentiate \\nbetween normal processes and a complication, the section also includes a \\ndescription of normal labour and childbirth, including use of the \\npartograph and active management of the third stage. Guidance on the \\ninitial care of the normal newborn is also provided. Finally, this section \\nalso outlines the linkage between providers and their community and how \\nto provide emotional support to the woman and her family. \\nSection 2 describes the symptoms by which women with complications of \\npregnancy and childbirth present. The symptoms reflect the major causes \\nof mortality and morbidity. For each symptom there is a statement of \\ngeneral, initial management. Where relevant, diagnosis tables lead to \\nidentifying the diagnosis which is causing the symptom. Simplified \\nmanagement protocols for these specific diagnoses then follow. Where \\nthere are several choices of therapy, the most effective and inexpensive is \\nchosen. Also in this section is information on management for immediate \\n(within the first 24 hours) conditions or problems of the newborn. \\nSection 3 describes the procedures that may be necessary in the \\nmanagement of complications of pregnancy and childbirth. These \\nprocedures are not intended to be detailed “how-to” instructions but rather \\na summary of the main steps associated with each procedure. Because \\ngeneral operative care principles are summarized in Section 1, these are not \\nrepeated for each procedure, unless there is care required that is specific to \\nthe procedure (e.g. post-procedure care for ketamine anaesthesia). Clear \\nguidance is provided on drugs and dosages, a wide variety of anaesthesia \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='xiv How to Use This Manual \\noptions (e.g. safe caesarean under local anaesthesia) and safe, effective and \\nlower-cost techniques (e.g. single layer closure of the uterus). \\nA list of essential drugs is included as an appendix to the manual. Finally, \\nthe manual’s index is organized so that it can be used in an emergency \\nsituation to find relevant material quickly. The most critical information, \\nincluding diagnosis, management and steps for a procedure, is listed first in \\nbold. Other relevant entries follow in alphabetical order. Only the pages \\ncontaining critical or relevant information are included, rather than every \\npage that contains a word or phrase.

It can also be a time \\nof anxiety and concern. Listening and talking respectfully and sensitively \\nwith a woman and her family can help build the woman’s trust and \\nconfidence in her health care providers. \\nWomen who develop complications may have difficulty talking to the \\nprovider and explaining their problem. It is the responsibility of the entire \\nhealth care team to speak with the woman respectfully and put her at ease. \\nFocusing on the woman means that the health care provider and staff:  \\n• respect the woman’s dignity and right to privacy;  \\n• respect the woman’s right to information and informed consent;  \\n• respect the woman’s right to decline any treatment or procedures \\noffered;  \\n• respect the woman’s choices and preferences, including \\ncompanionship during maternity care, procedures and treatment; \\n• protect a woman’s privacy rights and protections with respect to her \\nhealth information, including how her health information is used and \\nto whom her information is disclosed by health care providers; \\n• are sensitive and responsive to the woman’s needs; \\n• are nonjudgmental about the decisions that the woman and her family \\nmake regarding the woman’s care. \\nIt is understandable to disagree with a woman’s risky behaviour or a \\ndecision that has resulted in a delay in seeking care. It is not acceptable, \\nhowever, to show disrespect for a woman or disregard for a medical \\ncondition that you believe is a result of her behaviour. Provide respectful \\ncorrective counselling after the complication has been dealt with, not \\nbefore or during management of the problem. \\n \\nRIGHTS OF WOMEN \\nProviders should be aware of the rights of women when receiving \\nmaternity care services: \\n• Every woman receiving care has the right to information about her \\nhealth. \\n• Every woman has the right to discuss her concerns in an environment \\nin which she feels confident. \\n• A woman should know in advance the type of procedure that is going \\nto be performed.

The concept \\nof safe motherhood is usually restricted to physical safety, but childbearing \\nis also an important rite of passage, which may have deep personal and \\ncultural significance for a woman and her family. The notion of safe \\nmotherhood must be expanded beyond the prevention of morbidity and \\nmortality to encompass respect for women’s basic human rights, including \\nwomen’s autonomy, dignity, feelings, and choices and preferences, \\nincluding the choice of companionship, wherever possible. \\n \\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNICATION AND \\nSUPPORT \\nEmergency situations are disturbing for all concerned, and they evoke a \\nrange of emotions that can have significant consequences. Because each \\nemergency is unique, this chapter offers general guidance for responding to \\nemotional and psychosocial needs in emergencies. Honest communication \\nand genuine empathy are probably the most important keys to effective \\ncare in such situations. In addition, health care staff must try to understand \\nand acknowledge the specific needs and cultural practices of individual \\nwomen and their families, including the potentially differing needs of \\nindividual family members.  \\nIn general, women need opportunities to talk about their pregnancy and \\nbirth experience(s) and to be reassured that they will be well cared for \\nduring pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Good \\ncommunication encompasses the following: an explanation of events; an \\nexplanation of findings and exploration of courses of action that will assist \\nthe woman in making informed decisions; an opportunity to discuss \\nfeelings such as loss, fear, anger and self-blame; social support; and a \\ndiscussion of possible future childbearing. \\n \\nEMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS \\nMultiple factors may influence women’s psychological status before, \\nduring and after pregnancy. A woman’s psychological status in turn \\ninfluences her ability to care for herself and her baby and to follow health \\ncare recommendations. Therefore, to achieve optimal outcomes, it is as  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='C-10 Emotional and psychological support \\nimportant to provide emotional and psychological support as it is to \\nprovide medical care. \\nCommon reactions to an obstetric/newborn emergency or death include: \\n• denial (feelings that “it can’t be true”); \\n• guilt regarding possible responsibility; \\n• anger (frequently directed toward health care staff but often masking \\nanger that parents direct at themselves for “failure”); \\n• blame, fear, anxiety, sorrow, grief and a sense of failure; \\n• bargaining (particularly if the woman/baby hovers for a while between \\nlife and death); \\n• depression and loss of self-esteem, which may be long-lasting; \\n• isolation (feelings of being different or separate from others), which \\nmay be reinforced by caregivers who might avoid people who \\nexperience loss; and disorientation. \\nHow each member of the family reacts to an emergency situation depends \\non:  \\n• the woman’s support systems, including her relationship with her \\npartner and the presence of family or supportive individuals; \\n• the social situation of the woman/couple and their cultural and \\nreligious practices, beliefs and expectations; \\n• the woman’s previous pregnancy outcomes, chronic medical problems \\nand history of psychiatric problems, sexual and domestic abuse, or \\nsubstance abuse; \\n• the personalities of the people involved and the quality and nature of \\nsocial, practical and emotional support; and \\n• the nature, gravity and prognosis of the problem and the availability \\nand quality of health care services. \\nAwareness and recognition of these factors can help maternal health care \\nproviders better support women and their families.

People experiencing an emergency will not remember much \\nof what is said to them. \\n• Remember to care for staff who themselves may experience guilt, \\ngrief, confusion and other emotions.

It typically occurs in \\nthe early postpartum weeks or months and may persist for a year or more. \\nDepression is not necessarily one of the leading symptoms, although it is \\nusually evident. Other symptoms include exhaustion, irritability, \\nweepiness, low energy and motivational levels, feelings of helplessness \\nand hopelessness, loss of libido, and appetite and sleep disturbances. \\nHeadache, asthma, backache, vaginal discharge and abdominal pain may \\nbe reported. Symptoms might also include obsessional thinking, fear of \\nharming the baby or self, suicidal thoughts, and depersonalization.  \\nThe prognosis for postpartum depression is good with early diagnosis and \\ntreatment. More than two thirds of women recover within a year. \\nFacilitating the presence of a companion of choice during pregnancy, \\nlabour, childbirth and the postpartum period may help prevent postpartum \\ndepression.  \\nWomen should routinely be screened for depression during postpartum \\nvisits: \\n• At each postnatal contact, women should be asked about their \\nemotional well-being, what family and social support they have, and \\ntheir usual coping strategies for dealing with day-to-day matters. All \\nwomen and their families/partners should be encouraged to tell their \\nhealth care professional about any changes in mood, emotional state or \\nbehaviour that are outside the woman’s normal pattern.  \\n• At 10–14 days after birth, all women should be asked about resolution \\nof mild, transitory postpartum depression (“maternal blues”/“baby \\nblues”). If symptoms have not resolved, the woman’s psychological \\nwell-being should continue to be assessed for postnatal depression \\nand, if symptoms persist, further evaluated. \\nWomen who screen positive for postnatal depression should be linked to \\nongoing care, including further diagnostic evaluation and ongoing \\ntreatment as indicated. In addition, surveillance for maternal depression \\ncan be performed at pediatric visits in the first 12 months postpartum.  \\nRisk factors for postpartum depression include: \\n• Previous postpartum depression; \\n• Active or previous mental illness; \\n• Being a member of a vulnerable population; \\n• Traumatic childbirth; '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='Emotional and psychological support  C-19 \\n• Giving birth to a preterm or stillborn infant or experiencing the death \\nof a newborn; \\n• Having an infant admitted to intensive care; \\n• History of being a neglected child. \\nOnce established, postpartum depression requires psychological \\ncounselling and ongoing practical support. In general: \\n• Psychosocial interventions should be the first line of management of \\ndepression during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Antidepressant \\nmedication should be avoided as much as possible in this population. \\n• Listen to the woman and provide encouragement. \\n• Incorporate general principles of care: provide empathic, clear and \\nsensitive communication with women and their families, and mobilize \\nand provide social support. \\n• Assure the woman that the experience is fairly common; many other \\nwomen experience the same thing and most women are able to \\nrecover. \\n• Provide psycho-education and avoid over-medicalization. To avoid \\nstigma, use commonly understood terms such as stress and burden \\ninstead of depressive disorder or illness. \\n• Assist the woman in rethinking her image of motherhood, and assist \\nthe couple in thinking through their respective roles as new parents. \\nThey may need to adjust their expectations and activities. \\n• Provide adjunct treatments such as structured physical activity, \\nrelaxation and problem-solving, if available, and integrate these \\nactivities into the woman’s daily routine. \\n• Facilitate social support for the woman throughout the intervention. \\n• Give attention to the woman’s overall well-being, attending to her \\nphysical as well as psychological health and emphasizing the \\nimportance of the mother-infant relationship in this period. \\n• Provide practical help (with the baby and with home care). \\n• If depression is severe, women may benefit from treatment with an \\nantidepressant medication.

Severe postpartum depression may be associated with psychosis. \\nSymptoms of postpartum psychosis include delusions, hallucinations, sleep \\ndisturbances, obsessive thoughts about the baby, severe depression, \\nanxiety, despair, and suicidal or infanticidal impulses. Women who have \\nbipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder have a higher risk of \\ndeveloping postpartum psychosis. About half of women experiencing \\npostpartum psychosis have a history of mental illness.  \\nThe prognosis for recovery is excellent, but about 50% of women will \\nsuffer a relapse with subsequent births. Postpartum psychosis is a mental \\nhealth emergency and requires immediate attention to prevent the woman \\nfrom harming herself or her baby. In general: \\n• Immediately seek comprehensive psychiatric and medical care. \\n• A woman with active psychosis should not care for her infant “as \\nusual.” Arrangements should be made for supplemental care to ensure \\nthe safety of the newborn. \\n• Family members should remain with the woman at all times.  \\n• Often, hospitalization is required for women with postpartum \\npsychosis. \\n• Provide psychological support and arrange for practical help with the \\nbaby and with home care, including measures to ensure that the baby \\nremains safe until the psychosis has resolved. \\n• Listen to the woman and provide support for her and her family, \\nincluding linkages for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment, as \\nindicated. This is important for avoiding tragic outcomes. \\n• Lessen stress.  \\n• Avoid dealing with emotional issues when the woman is unstable.  \\n• If antipsychotic medications are used, be aware that medication can \\nbe passed through breastmilk, so decisions about treatment must take \\ninto consideration and address a woman’s breastfeeding status.

Have one person go for help and have another \\nperson gather emergency equipment and supplies (e.g. oxygen \\ncylinder, emergency kit). \\n• If the woman is unconscious, assess the airway, breathing and \\ncirculation. Begin resuscitation of the woman, as needed (e.g. assist \\nbreathing, start intravenous infusion). \\n• If shock is suspected, immediately begin treatment (page S-1). Even \\nif signs of shock are not present, keep shock in mind as you evaluate \\nthe woman further, because her status may worsen rapidly. If shock \\ndevelops, it is important to begin treatment immediately. \\n• Position the woman lying down on her left side with her feet elevated. \\nLoosen tight clothing. \\n• Talk to the woman and help her stay calm. Ask her or someone with \\nher what happened, what symptoms she is experiencing and when they \\nstarted. \\n• Perform a rapid evaluation of the woman’s general condition, level \\nof consciousness, presence of anxiety and/or confusion, blood loss, \\ncolour, and temperature of skin (page C-1). \\n• Put in one or two large-bore IV cannulae/needles. \\n• Get blood samples before infusing IV fluids. \\n• Infuse IV fluids. Adjust the flow rate based on the woman’s condition \\nand potential risks of fluid overload (e.g. pre-eclampsia). \\n• Perform a rapid targeted history and physical examination to make a \\ndifferential diagnosis of the problem. \\n• Stabilize the woman. \\n• Consider catheterization if monitoring urinary output or a distended \\nbladder. \\n• Document history, findings, actions and plan for continued \\nmanagement based on the cause of the emergency.

It is important to use \\nblood, blood products and replacement fluids appropriately and to be \\naware of the principles designed to assist health workers in deciding when \\n(and when not) to transfuse. \\nThe appropriate use of blood products is defined as the transfusion of safe \\nblood products to treat a condition leading to significant morbidity or \\nmortality that cannot be prevented or managed effectively by other means. \\nConditions that might require blood transfusion include: \\n• postpartum haemorrhage leading to shock; \\n• loss of a large volume of blood at operative birth; and \\n• severe anaemia, especially in later pregnancy or if accompanied by \\ncardiac failure. \\nNote: For anaemia in early pregnancy, treat the cause of anaemia and \\nprovide haematinics. \\nDistrict hospitals should be prepared for the urgent need for blood \\ntransfusion.

When there is sudden rapid loss of blood due to \\nhaemorrhage, surgery or complications of childbirth, the most urgent need \\nis usually the rapid replacement of the fluid lost from circulation. \\nBlood that has not been obtained from appropriately selected donors \\nand that has not been screened for transfusion-transmissible \\ninfectious agents (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) in accordance with national \\nrequirements should not be issued for transfusion, other than in the \\nmost exceptional life-threatening situations.

Colloids tend to remain in the blood where \\nthey mimic plasma proteins to maintain or raise the colloid osmotic \\npressure of blood. \\n• Colloids are usually given in a volume equal to the blood volume lost. \\nIn many conditions where the capillary permeability is increased  \\n(e.g. trauma, sepsis), leakage out of the circulation will occur and \\nadditional infusions will be necessary to maintain blood volume. \\nPoints to remember: \\n• There is no evidence that colloid solutions (albumin, dextrans, \\ngelatins, hydroxyethyl starch solutions) have advantages over normal \\nsaline or balanced salt solutions for resuscitation. \\n• There is evidence that colloid solutions may have an adverse effect on \\nsurvival. \\n• Colloid solutions are much more expensive than normal saline and \\nbalanced salt solutions. \\n• Human plasma should not be used as a replacement fluid. All forms of \\nplasma carry a risk, similar to that of whole blood, of transmitting \\ninfection, such as HIV and hepatitis. \\n• Plain water should never be infused intravenously. It will cause \\nhaemolysis and will probably be fatal. \\nSAFETY \\nBefore giving any IV infusion: \\n• check that the seal of the infusion bottle or bag is not broken; \\n• check the expiry date; \\n• check that the solution is clear and free of visible particles. \\nDextrose (glucose) solutions are poor replacement fluids.

In general, antibiotics that have been \\nassociated with a significant prior allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) \\nshould not be given unless under the close supervision of a trained \\nphysician. However, if the reported antibiotic allergic reaction was mild \\n(e.g. rash) and did not involve systemic symptoms, then it is reasonable, if \\nother options do not exist, to give a carefully supervised trial of the \\nantibiotic. In general, there is up to a 10% chance that a woman with a \\nprior allergic reaction to penicillin may have an allergic reaction to a \\ncephalosporin. \\n \\nANAPHYLAXIS  \\nAnaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that depends on rapid \\nand timely management.  \\n• Symptoms of anaphylaxis can include:  \\n- a sense of tingling  \\n- flushing  \\n- swelling of the face, lips and tongue  \\n- difficulty breathing due to swelling of the throat and airway  \\n- shortness of breath  \\n- abdominal cramps  \\n- palpitations  \\n- syncope  \\n• Administer adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mg IM immediately, and repeat every \\n10 to 15 minutes, as needed.

Supportive care during labour provides reassurance \\nand decreases the perception of pain (page C-86). \\n• If a woman is distressed by pain, encourage her to walk around or \\nassume any comfortable position. Encourage her companion to \\nmassage her back or sponge her face between contractions. Encourage \\nthe use of breathing techniques and allow the woman to take a warm \\nbath or shower if she chooses. For most women, this is enough to cope \\nwith the pain of labour. If necessary, offer the woman: \\n- morphine 0.1 mg/kg body weight IM every four hours as needed, \\ninforming her of the advantages and disadvantages (see below) \\nand obtaining consent; \\n- promethazine 25 mg IM or IV if vomiting occurs. \\n \\n \\nDANGER \\nIf morphine is given to the woman within four hours before she gives \\nbirth, the baby may suffer from respiratory depression. Naloxone is the \\nantidote. \\nNote: Do not administer naloxone to newborns whose mothers are \\nsuspected of having recently abused narcotic drugs. \\n• If there are signs of respiratory depression in the newborn, begin \\nresuscitation immediately: \\n- After vital signs have been established, give naloxone 0.1 mg/kg \\nbody weight IV to the newborn.  \\n- If the infant has adequate peripheral circulation after \\nsuccessful resuscitation, naloxone can be given IM. Repeated \\ndoses may be required to prevent recurrent respiratory depression. \\nBarbiturates and sedatives should not be used to relieve anxiety in \\nlabour.

The dose must be adjusted to the weight and condition of the \\nwoman and to the condition of the fetus (when present).

Women who are comfortable during a procedure are less \\nlikely to move and cause injury to themselves. Pain management can \\ninclude: \\n• emotional support and encouragement \\n• local anaesthesia \\n• regional anaesthesia (e.g. spinal) \\n• general anaesthesia. \\n \\nANTIBIOTICS \\n• Give prophylactic antibiotics before starting the procedure  \\n(page C-50).  \\n \\nMAKING THE INCISION \\n• When choosing the incision type, carefully consider the woman’s past \\nsurgical history, the indication for surgery, and potential technical \\ndifficulties and complications. For example, for an obstructed labour \\ncase with Bandl’s ring formation, a sub-umbilical midline incision \\nmay be preferable to a Pfannenstiel’s incision. \\n• Make the incision only as large as necessary for the procedure. \\n• Make the incision with great care and proceed one layer at a time. \\n \\nHANDLING TISSUE \\n• Handle tissue gently. \\n• When using clamps, close the clamp only one ratchet (click), when \\npossible. This will minimize discomfort and reduce the amount of \\ndead tissue that remains behind at the end of the procedure, thus \\ndecreasing the risk of infection. \\n \\nHAEMOSTASIS \\nHaemostasis is the process in which blood is maintained in a fluid state and \\nconfined to the vascular system.

Therefore, \\nkeep blood loss to a minimum. \\n \\nINSTRUMENTS AND SHARPS \\n• Start and finish the procedure with a count of instruments, sharps and \\nsponges: \\n- Perform the count every time a body cavity (e.g. uterus) is closed; \\n- Document in the woman’s record that the surgical counts were \\ncorrect.  \\n• Use instruments, especially sharps, carefully to reduce the risk of \\ninjury (page C-32). Use “safe zones” when handling and passing \\ninstruments and sharps: \\n- Use a pan such as a kidney basin to carry and pass sharp items, \\nand pass suture needles on a needle holder. \\n- Alternatively, pass the instrument with the handle, rather than the \\nsharp end, pointing toward the receiver. \\n \\nDRAINAGE \\n• Always leave an abdominal drain in place if: \\n- bleeding persists after hysterectomy; \\n- a clotting disorder is suspected; \\n- infection is present or suspected; or \\n- a bladder or ureteral injury is suspected or has been identified and \\nrepaired. \\n• A closed drainage system can be used, or a corrugated rubber drain \\ncan be placed through the abdominal wall or pouch of Douglas. \\n• Remove the drain once the infection has cleared or when no pus or \\nblood-stained fluid has drained for 48 hours. \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='Operative care principles C-71 \\nSUTURE \\n• Select the appropriate type and size of suture for the tissue  \\n(Table C-7).

Keep the dressing on the \\nwound for the first day after surgery to protect against infection while  \\nre-epithelialization occurs. Thereafter, a dressing is not necessary. \\n• If blood or fluid is leaking through the initial dressing, do not \\nchange the dressing: \\n- Reinforce the dressing. \\n- Monitor the amount of blood/fluid lost by outlining the blood \\nstain on the dressing with a pen. \\n- If bleeding increases or the blood stain covers half the \\ndressing or more, remove the dressing and inspect the wound. \\nReplace with another sterile dressing. \\n• If the dressing comes loose, reinforce with more tape rather than \\nremoving the dressing. This will help maintain the sterility of the \\ndressing and reduce the risk of wound infection. \\n• Change the dressing using sterile technique. \\n• The wound should be clean and dry, without evidence of infection or \\nseroma, before the woman’s discharge from the hospital.  \\n \\nANALGESIA \\nAdequate postoperative pain control is important (page C-55).

Types of abortion \\nSpontaneous abortion is defined as the loss of a pregnancy before fetal viability (22 \\nweeks of gestation). The stages of spontaneous abortion may include: \\n• threatened abortion (pregnancy may continue); \\n• inevitable abortion (pregnancy will not continue and will proceed to \\nincomplete/complete abortion); \\n• incomplete abortion (products of conception are partially expelled); \\n• complete abortion (products of conception are completely expelled).  \\n \\nInduced abortion is defined as a process by which pregnancy is terminated before \\nfetal viability. \\nUnsafe abortion is defined as a procedure performed either by persons lacking \\nnecessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.  \\nSeptic abortion is defined as abortion complicated by infection. Sepsis may result \\nfrom infection if organisms rise from the lower genital tract following either \\nspontaneous or unsafe abortion. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there are retained \\nproducts of conception and evacuation has been delayed. Sepsis is a frequent \\ncomplication of unsafe abortion involving instrumentation. \\n \\nSPECIFIC MANAGEMENT \\nIf unsafe abortion is suspected, examine for signs of infection or uterine, vaginal \\nor bowel injury (Table S-2, page S-9), and thoroughly irrigate the vagina to \\nremove any herbs, local medications or caustic substances. \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 154}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-11 \\n \\nTHREATENED ABORTION \\n• Medical treatment is usually not necessary.  \\n• Advise the woman to avoid strenuous activity and sexual intercourse, \\nbut bed rest is not necessary. \\n• If bleeding stops, follow up in an antenatal clinic.

Managing inevitable and incomplete abortion \\n• In cases of inevitable and incomplete abortion, surgical evacuation and medical or \\nexpectant management are all reasonable management options. To determine the \\nbest course of action, one must take the following into consideration: \\n– the urgency of the particular case (i.e. haemodynamic stability); \\n– the skill set of the available providers and staff; \\n– the health facility setting and available materials, supplies and medications; \\nand \\n– the woman’s preference, after complete counselling on options.  \\n• Evacuation: If evacuation is appropriate and the woman prefers surgical \\nmanagement, examine the woman to determine if products of conception are \\nvisible in the os or the vagina and remove them with sponge or ring forceps. If \\nproducts are not visible, proceed with manual vacuum aspiration if gestational \\nage is less than 12–14 weeks (page P-75). Proceed with dilatation and evacuation \\n(D and E) (page S-18) if gestational age is more than 12–14 weeks and the \\nmajority of the products remain in the uterus. \\n• Medical Management: If medical management is determined to be appropriate \\n(i.e. the woman is haemodynamically stable and ectopic pregnancy is not \\nsuspected), and it is the woman’s preference, proceed with a medical protocol.  \\n- See Table S-4 (page S-13) for medical management protocols. Optimal \\ndoses for misoprostol in the setting of incomplete abortion have not been \\ndetermined. However, a reasonable protocol can be found in the \\nmanagement table. \\n- If misoprostol is not available, oxytocin is an option for medical \\nmanagement after 16 weeks.  \\n- If expulsion of products of conception is not achieved, proceed to \\nsurgical evacuation.  \\n- Ensure follow-up of the woman after treatment (page S-14). \\n• Expectant Management: Expectant management is a reasonable option if the \\nwoman is haemodynamically stable and prefers to avoid surgical or medical \\nintervention. \\n– Await spontaneous expulsion of products of conception. \\n– If spontaneous expulsion does not occur in a reasonable timeframe, \\ndepending on the woman’s tolerance for the discomfort and wait and her \\nhaemodynamic status, proceed to either medical management or evacuation \\nof the uterus via manual vacuum aspiration (page P-75) or D and E (page \\nS-18). \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 156}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-13 \\n \\nTABLE S-4.

Reassure her that the chances \\nfor a subsequent successful pregnancy are good unless there has been \\nsepsis or a cause of the abortion is identified that may have an adverse \\neffect on future pregnancies (this is rare). \\nSome women may want to become pregnant soon after having an abortion. \\nThey should be encouraged to delay the next pregnancy until they have \\ncompletely recovered. \\nAbortion care should always include comprehensive contraceptive \\ncounselling with initiation of the method of choice as soon as desired after \\nthe abortion.  \\nBefore the desired method is initiated, women should be assessed for \\nmedical eligibility (see WHO, Medical Eligibility Criteria for \\nContraceptive Use, 5th ed., 2015).  \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-15 \\n \\nTABLE S-6.

The fallopian tube is the most common site of ectopic \\nimplantation (greater than 90%). \\nSymptoms and signs are extremely variable, depending on whether or not \\nthe pregnancy has ruptured (Table S-7, page S-16). Culdocentesis  \\n(cul-de-sac puncture, page P-81) is an important tool for the diagnosis of \\nruptured ectopic pregnancy, but it is less useful than a serum pregnancy \\ntest combined with ultrasonography. If nonclotting blood is obtained, \\nbegin immediate management.

Symptoms and signs of unruptured and ruptured ectopic \\npregnancy \\nUnruptured Ectopic Pregnancy Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy \\n• Symptoms of early pregnancy (irregular \\nspotting or bleeding, nausea, swelling of \\nbreasts, bluish discolouration of vagina \\nand cervix, softening of cervix, slight \\nuterine enlargement, increased urinary \\nfrequency) \\n• Abdominal and pelvic pain \\n• Collapse and weakness \\n• Fast, weak pulse (110 beats per minute \\nor more) \\n• Hypotension \\n• Hypovolaemia \\n• Acute abdominal and pelvic pain \\n• Abdominal distensiona \\n• Rebound tenderness \\n• Pallor \\na A distended abdomen with shifting dullness may indicate free blood. \\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \\nThe most common differential diagnosis for ectopic pregnancy is \\nthreatened abortion. Others are acute or chronic pelvic inflammatory \\ndisease, ovarian cysts (torsion or rupture), and acute appendicitis. \\nIf available, ultrasound can help to distinguish a threatened abortion or \\ntwisted ovarian cyst from an ectopic pregnancy. \\n \\nIMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT \\n• Cross-match blood and arrange for immediate laparotomy. Do not \\nwait for blood before performing surgery. \\n• At surgery, inspect both ovaries and fallopian tubes: \\n- If there is extensive damage to the tube, perform salpingectomy \\n(the bleeding tube and the products of conception are removed \\ntogether). This is the treatment of choice in most cases (page  \\nP-131).  \\n- Rarely, if there is little tubal damage, perform salpingostomy \\n(the products of conception can be removed and the tube \\nconserved). Because the risk of another ectopic pregnancy is high, \\nthis should be done only when the conservation of fertility is very \\nimportant to the woman (page P-131). \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy  S-17 \\n \\nAutotransfusion \\nIf significant haemorrhage occurs, autotransfusion can be used if the \\nblood is unquestionably fresh and free of infection (in later stages of \\npregnancy, blood is contaminated [e.g. with amniotic fluid] and should not \\nbe used for autotransfusion). The blood can be collected before surgery or \\nafter the abdomen is opened: \\n• When the woman is on the operating table before surgery and the \\nabdomen is distended with blood, it is sometimes possible to insert a \\nneedle through the abdominal wall and collect the blood in a donor set.  \\n• Alternatively, open the abdomen: \\n- Scoop the blood into a basin and strain through gauze to remove \\nclots.  \\n- Clean the top portion of a blood donor bag with antiseptic solution \\nand open it with a sterile blade.  \\n- Pour the woman’s blood into the bag and reinfuse it through a \\nfiltered set in the usual way. \\n- If a donor bag with anticoagulant is not available, add sodium \\ncitrate 10 mL to each 90 mL of blood. \\n \\nSUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT \\n• Before discharge, provide counselling and advice on prognosis for \\nfertility. Given the increased risk of a future ectopic pregnancy, family \\nplanning counselling and provision of a family planning method, if \\ndesired, is especially important (Table S-6, page S-15). \\n• Correct anaemia with ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate 60 mg by \\nmouth daily for three months. \\n• Schedule a follow-up visit at four weeks.  \\n \\nMOLAR PREGNANCY \\nMolar pregnancy is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of chorionic \\nvilli. \\n \\nIMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT \\n• If the diagnosis of molar pregnancy is certain, cross-match blood if \\npossible and arrange for evacuation of the uterus: '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='S-18  Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy \\n- If cervical dilatation is needed, use a paracervical block (page \\nP-1). \\n- Use vacuum aspiration (page P-75). Manual vacuum aspiration is \\nsafer and associated with less blood loss than sharp metal \\ncurettage. The risk of perforation using the metal curette is high. \\n- Have three syringes prepared and ready for use during the \\nevacuation. The uterine contents are copious and it is important to \\nevacuate them rapidly. \\n• Infuse oxytocin 20 units in 1 L IV fluids (normal saline or Ringer’s \\nlactate) at a rate of 60 drops per minute to prevent haemorrhage once \\nevacuation is under way. \\n \\nSUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT \\n• Recommend a hormonal family planning method for at least one year \\nto prevent pregnancy (Table S-6, page S-15). Voluntary tubal ligation \\nmay be offered if the woman has completed her family. \\n• Follow up every eight weeks for at least one year with urine pregnancy \\ntests because of the risk of persistent trophoblastic disease or \\nchoriocarcinoma. Assess the woman for irregular bleeding through a \\nhistory and physical examination. If the urine pregnancy test is not \\nnegative after eight weeks or if it becomes positive again within the \\nfirst year, urgently refer the woman to a tertiary care centre for further \\nfollow-up and management of choriocarcinoma. \\n \\nDILATATION AND EVACUATION PROCEDURE  \\nAfter 14 weeks, a manual vacuum aspiration procedure and cannula might \\nnot be sufficient to evacuate the remaining intrauterine contents. In this \\ncase, it is necessary to use a heavy forceps to complete the evacuation.  \\n• Follow the manual vacuum aspiration procedure steps through \\nplacement of the tenaculum or vulsellum forceps.  \\n• Leave the tenaculum or vulsellum forceps in place on the anterior lip \\nof the cervix, or replace the forceps with a ring or sponge forceps if \\nthe tenaculum appears to be tearing the cervix.  \\n• Use graduated dilators to further dilate the cervix if the forceps do not \\npass easily through the cervix (page P-71).  \\n• Take care not to tear the cervix.

This may require multiple passes with the forceps.  \\nNote: The uterus is very soft in pregnancy and can easily be injured during the \\nprocedure. It is important that the operator understands the depth of the uterus and \\nthat the uterus will contract and the depth will decrease as the contents are \\nremoved. \\n• When all of the remaining fetal parts and placenta are removed, pass the \\nmanual vacuum aspiration cannula once more to ensure a gritty sensation \\nthroughout the uterus.  \\n• Evaluate all of the removed contents to ensure that all fetal parts are \\nidentified. Send the contents to histopathology if available and applicable.  \\n• Remove the tenaculum and ensure haemostasis at the puncture sites.  \\n• Assess the cervix for bleeding and tears.  \\n• If no tears are identified and bleeding is minimal, remove the speculum \\nand perform a bimanual exam to check the uterus for size and firmness.  \\n• Follow recommended post-procedure care (page P-73). \\n \\nAnti-D Immunoglobulin \\nIn settings where the prevalence of Rh-negative status is high and Rh-immunoglobulin \\nis routinely provided to Rh-negative women, administration of anti-D immunoglobulin \\nshould occur at the time of management of the abortion or ectopic or molar pregnancy. \\nThe dose of Rh-immunoglobulin may be reduced from 300 mcg (the dose used after a \\nterm birth) to 50 mcg in pregnancies less than 12 weeks duration.

There are, \\nhowever, some problems with these definitions: \\n• Estimates of blood loss are notoriously low, often half the actual loss. \\nBlood is mixed with amniotic fluid and sometimes with urine.

Other conditions that may cause convulsions or coma \\ninclude:  \\n• epilepsy \\n• complicated malaria  \\n• head injury  \\n• meningitis  \\n• encephalitis. \\n(See Table S-12, page S-52 for more information on the differential \\ndiagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy). \\n \\nBLOOD PRESSURE \\nDiagnose hypertension in pregnancy if on two consecutive readings taken \\nfour hours or more apart:  '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/My_PDFs_AIML1/Copy of (WHO)Managing_Complications_Pregnancy_Childbirth.pdf', 'page': 194}, page_content='Elevated blood pressure, headache, blurred vision, convulsions or loss of consciousness  S-51 \\n \\n• systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or higher and/or  \\n• diastolic blood pressure is 90 mmHg or higher. \\nNote: Blood pressure is in the severe range if the systolic blood pressure \\nis 160 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or \\nhigher. \\nIf hypertension occurs for the first time after 20 weeks of gestation, \\nduring labour and/or within 48 hours of giving birth, it is gestational \\nhypertension, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, depending on the presence of \\nother features (see Table S-12, page S-52). \\nIf hypertension occurs before 20 weeks of gestation, it is most likely \\nchronic hypertension. Because some women’s blood pressure might not be \\nmeasured before 20 weeks of gestation, chronic hypertension may be \\nidentified for the first time during pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation. \\nChronic hypertension will persist beyond 12 weeks postpartum. \\n \\nPROTEINURIA \\nThe presence of proteinuria changes the diagnosis from gestational \\nhypertension to pre-eclampsia. Because vaginal secretions or amniotic \\nfluid may contaminate a urine specimen, only clean-catch midstream \\nspecimens should be used. Catheterization for this purpose is not justified \\ndue to the risk of urinary tract infection. \\nDiagnostic criteria for proteinuria include: two urine dipstick \\nmeasurements of at least 2+ (30 mg per dL) taken six hours apart; at least \\n300 mg of protein in a 24-hour urine sample; or a urinary protein/creatinine \\nratio of 0.3 or greater. \\nIt is important to rule out pre-eclampsia before assigning another etiology \\nfor the presence of proteinuria in a pregnant woman with elevated blood \\npressure. However, other conditions can cause proteinuria and false \\npositive results are possible. Urinary tract infection, severe anaemia, heart \\nfailure and difficult labour may all cause proteinuria. Blood in the urine \\ndue to catheter trauma or schistosomiasis and contamination from vaginal \\nblood can give false positive results. \\nRandom urine sampling, such as the dipstick test for protein, is a useful \\nscreening tool. A change from negative to positive during pregnancy is a \\nwarning sign. If dipsticks are not available, a sample of urine can be heated \\nto boiling in a clean test tube.

Her contractions are regular, occurring once every 10 minutes, each lasting for 20 seconds. Her vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, are within normal ranges. Her fetal heart rate is also within the normal range, at 140 beats per minute with no decelerations noted. Her cervix is mostly effaced, and she still has her membranes intact. At 4 cm dilatation, Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor, and it is not uncommon for this phase to last for several hours. Further evaluation and close monitoring should be conducted to assess her progress and determine any necessary interventions. It's important to continue monitoring her contractions, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate to ensure a safe, healthy delivery for both Mrs. A and her baby. Any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate should be addressed immediately.\n",

            "As Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor at 4 cm cervical dilation, close monitoring and evaluation of her labor pattern, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate are required. Regular contractions and a steady FHR of 140 beats per minute with no decelerations are noted, and her cervix is mostly effaced. However, as labor can last for several hours, it is recommended to initiate fetal heart rate monitoring every 15-30 minutes and to document any variations in the pattern. If any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate are noticed, prompt intervention, such as administering oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, or uterine stimulants, should be implemented. Additionally, continuous fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring may be necessary to ensure safe delivery of the baby. It is also important to monitor Mrs. A's hydration status, pain management, and any potential complications, such as fetal distress, maternal exhaustion, or cervical stasis. These interventions and monitoring should be initiated as deemed necessary by the healthcare provider based on Mrs. A's individual clinical circumstances.\n",

At 4 cm dilatation, Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor, and it is not uncommon for this phase to last for several hours. Further evaluation and close monitoring should be conducted to assess her progress and determine any necessary interventions. It's important to continue monitoring her contractions, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate to ensure a safe, healthy delivery for both Mrs. A and her baby. Any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate should be addressed immediately.\n",

            "As Mrs. A is in the active phase of labor at 4 cm cervical dilation, close monitoring and evaluation of her labor pattern, cervical dilation, and fetal heart rate are required. Regular contractions and a steady FHR of 140 beats per minute with no decelerations are noted, and her cervix is mostly effaced. However, as labor can last for several hours, it is recommended to initiate fetal heart rate monitoring every 15-30 minutes and to document any variations in the pattern. If any concerning changes in her labor pattern or fetal heart rate are noticed, prompt intervention, such as administering oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, or uterine stimulants, should be implemented. Additionally, continuous fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring may be necessary to ensure safe delivery of the baby.

Her contractions are mild and irregular, occurring once every 20 seconds. Her vital signs are stable with a pulse rate of 88 and a blood pressure of 130/80. Her fetal heart rate is within normal range at 140 beats per minute and has not shown any decelerations. Her cervix is mostly effaced and dilated to 4 centimeters. The membranes are still intact. These findings indicate that Mrs. A is in the early stages of labor, and further monitoring and assessment will be necessary to evaluate the progress of the labor and determine the need for any interventions or medical management. It is important to continue monitoring the fetal heart rate and assessing the strength and frequency of contractions, as well as checking for any signs of fetal distress or abnormalities. Additionally, the cervical dilatation should be regularly evaluated to ensure that it is progressing in a satisfactory manner. Any deviations from normal labor progression, such as prolonged active phase of labor or fetal distress, should be addressed promptly and appropriately to ensure a safe and successful childbirth.\n",

            "Based on the given medical documentation, it appears that Mrs. A is currently in labor at 39 weeks gestation with no significant antepartum complications. Her contractions are mild and irregular, occurring once every 20 seconds. Her vital signs are stable with a pulse rate of 88 and a blood pressure of 130/80. Her fetal heart rate is within normal range at 140 beats per minute and has not shown any decelerations. Her cervix is mostly effaced and dilated to 4 centimeters. The membranes are still intact. These findings indicate that Mrs. A is in the early stages of labor, and further monitoring and assessment will be necessary to evaluate the progress of the labor and determine the need for any interventions or medical management. It is important to continue monitoring the fetal heart rate and assessing the strength and frequency of contractions, as well as checking for any signs of fetal distress or abnormalities. Additionally, the cervical dilatation should be regularly evaluated to ensure that it is progressing in a satisfactory manner. Any deviations from normal labor progression, such as prolonged active phase of labor or fetal distress, should be addressed promptly and appropriately to ensure a safe and successful childbirth.\n",

            "The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in Mrs. C at her previous pregnancy, coupled with her current presentation in active labor, may have implications on her current labor and delivery. Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy can lead to increased blood loss during childbirth, which may exacerbate an already low hemoglobin level. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor and manage any blood loss during the delivery process. Additionally, the anemia may also affect Mrs. C's energy levels and ability to cope with the physical demands of labor, which may warrant the need for additional medical and emotional support. The use of Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide), a medication to relieve uterine contractions, has been administered to Mrs. C, which may help to manage the intensity of her labor pains. Further management of the iron deficiency anemia may involve the administration of iron and folate supplements, especially in the postpartum period to replenish any iron and folate stores depleted during labor and childbirth. Close monitoring of the hemoglobin levels, as well as the management of any blood loss, will be required to ensure the best possible outcomes for both Mrs. C and her newborn.\n",

A nasogastric tube may be inserted for feeding, as sucking and swallowing can cause further exhaustion during the initial stages of respiratory distress. Additionally, chest physiotherapy may help to clear any secretions from the lungs, which can further exacerbate respiratory distress. The medical team may also consider administering surfactant, which can help to improve lung compliance and reduce the work of breathing. Close observation, regular assessment, and prompt medical intervention will be required to ensure that Baby A.'s respiratory distress is adequately managed.\n",
